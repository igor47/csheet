E xcEptions supErsEdE GEnEral rulEs
General rules govern each part of the game. For
example, the combat rules tell you that melee at-
tacks use Strength and ranged attacks use Dexterity.
That’s a general rule, and a general rule is in effect as
long as something in the game doesn’t explicitly say
otherwise.
The game also includes elements—class features,
feats, weapon properties, spells, magic items, mon-
ster abilities, and the like—that sometimes contra-
dict a general rule. When an exception and a general
rule disagree, the exception wins. For example, if a
feature says you can make melee attacks using your
Charisma, you can do so, even though that statement
disagrees with the general rule.
round down
Whenever you divide or multiply a number in the
game, round down if you end up with a fraction, even
if the fraction is one-half or greater. Some rules make
an exception and tell you to round up.
Playing the Game
Rhythm of Play
The three main pillars of D&D play are social in-
teraction, exploration, and combat. Whichever one
you’re experiencing, the game unfolds according to
this basic pattern:
1: The Game Master Describes a Scene. The GM
tells the players where their adventurers are and
what’s around them (how many doors lead out of
a room, what’s on a table, and so on).
2: The Players Describe What Their Characters
Do. Typically, the characters stick together as
they travel through a dungeon or another envi-
ronment. Sometimes different adventurers do
different things: one adventurer might search a
treasure chest while a second examines a mys-
terious symbol engraved on a wall and a third
keeps watch for monsters. Outside combat, the
GM ensures that every character has a chance to
act and decides how to resolve their activity. In
combat, the characters take turns.
3: The GM Narrates the Results of the Adventur-
ers’ Actions. Sometimes resolving a task is easy.
If an adventurer walks across a room and tries to
open a door, the GM might say the door opens and
describe what lies beyond. But the door might be
locked, the floor might hide a trap, or some other
circumstance might make it challenging for an
adventurer to complete a task. In those cases, the
GM might ask the player to roll a die to help de-
termine what happens. Describing the results of-
ten leads to another decision point, which brings
the game back to step 1.
This pattern holds during every game session
(each time you sit down to play D&D), whether the
adventurers are talking to a noble, exploring a ruin,
or fighting a dragon. In certain situations—partic-
ularly combat—the action is more structured, and
everyone takes turns.
The Six Abilities
All creatures—characters and monsters—have six
abilities that measure physical and mental charac-
teristics, as shown on the Ability Descriptions table.
Ability Descriptions
Ability Score Measures …
Strength Physical might
Dexterity Agility, reflexes, and balance
Constitution Health and stamina
Intelligence Reasoning and memory
Wisdom Perceptiveness and mental fortitude
Charisma Confidence, poise, and charm
Ability Scores
Each ability has a score from 1 to 20, although some
monsters have a score as high as 30. The score
represents the magnitude of an ability. The Ability
Scores table summarizes what the scores mean.
Ability Scores
Score Meaning
1 This is the lowest a score can normally go.
If an effect reduces a score to 0, that effect
explains what happens.
2–9 This represents a weak capability.
10–11 This represents the human average.
12–19 This represents a strong capability.
20 This is the highest an adventurer’s score can
go unless a feature says otherwise.
21–29 This represents an extraordinary capability.
30 This is the highest a score can go.
Ability Modifiers
Each ability has a modifier that you apply whenever
you make a D20 Test with that ability (explained in
“D20 Tests”). An ability modifier is derived from its
score, as shown in the Ability Modifiers table.

Ability Modifiers
Score Modifier
1 −5
2–3 −4
4–5 −3
6–7 −2

D20 Tests
When the outcome of an action is uncertain, the
game uses a d20 roll to determine success or fail-
ure. These rolls are called D20 Tests, and they come
in three kinds: ability checks, saving throws, and
attack rolls. They follow these steps:
4: Roll 1d20. You always want to roll high. If the
roll has Advantage or Disadvantage (described
later in “Playing the Game”), you roll two d20s,
but you use the number from only one of them—
the higher one if you have Advantage or the lower
one if you have Disadvantage.
5: Add Modifiers. Add these modifiers to the num-
ber rolled on the d20:
• The Relevant Ability Modifier. “Playing the
Game” and “Rules Glossary” explain which ability
modifiers to use for various D20 Tests.
• Your Proficiency Bonus If Relevant. Each crea-
ture has a Proficiency Bonus, a number added
when making a D20 Test that uses something,
such as a skill, in which the creature has pro-
ficiency. See “Proficiency” later in “Playing the
Game.”
• Circumstantial Bonuses and Penalties. A class
feature, a spell, or another rule might give a bonus
or penalty to the die roll.
6: Compare the Total to a Target Number. If the
total of the d20 and its modifiers equals or ex-
ceeds the target number, the D20 Test succeeds.
Otherwise, it fails. The Game Master determines
target numbers and tells players whether their
rolls are successful. The target number for an
ability check or a saving throw is called a Diffi-
culty Class (DC). The target number for an attack
roll is called an Armor Class (AC), which appears
on a character sheet or in a stat block (see “Rules
Glossary”).
Ability Checks
An ability check represents a creature using talent
and training to try to overcome a challenge, such as
forcing open a stuck door, picking a lock, entertain-
ing a crowd, or deciphering a cipher. The GM and the
rules often call for an ability check when a creature
attempts something other than an attack that has a
chance of meaningful failure. When the outcome is
uncertain and narratively interesting, the dice de-
termine the result.
Ability Modifier
An ability check is named for the ability modifier it
uses: a Strength check, an Intelligence check, and so
on. Different ability checks are called for in differ-
ent situations, depending on which ability is most
relevant. See the Ability Check Examples table for
examples of each check’s use.
Ability Check Examples
Ability Make a Check To …
Strength Lift, push, pull, or break something
Dexterity Move nimbly, quickly, or quietly
Constitution Push your body beyond normal limits
Intelligence Reason or remember
Wisdom Notice things in the environment or in
creatures’ behavior
Charisma Influence, entertain, or deceive
Proficiency Bonus
Add your Proficiency Bonus to an ability check
when the GM determines that a skill or tool pro-
ficiency is relevant to the check and you have
that proficiency. For example, if a rule refers to a
Strength (Acrobatics or Athletics) check, you can
add your Proficiency Bonus to the check if you have
proficiency in the Acrobatics or Athletics skill. See
“Proficiency” later in “Playing the Game” for more
information about skill and tool proficiencies.
Difficulty Class
The Difficulty Class of an ability check represents
the task’s difficulty. The more difficult the task,
the higher its DC. The rules provide DCs for certain
checks, but the GM ultimately sets them. The Typi-
cal Difficulty Classes table presents a range of pos-
sible DCs for ability checks.
Typical Difficulty Classes
Task Difficulty DC
Very easy 5
Easy 10
Medium 15
Hard 20
Task Difficulty DC
Very hard 25
Nearly impossible 30

Saving Throws
A saving throw—also called a save—represents an
attempt to evade or resist a threat, such as a fiery
explosion, a blast of poisonous gas, or a spell trying
to invade your mind. You don’t normally choose to
make a save; you must make one because your char-
acter or a monster (if you’re the GM) is at risk. A
save’s result is detailed in the effect that caused it.
If you don’t want to resist the effect, you can
choose to fail the save without rolling.
Ability Modifier
Saving throws are named for the ability modifiers
they use: a Constitution saving throw, a Wisdom
saving throw, and so on. Different saving throws are
used to resist different kinds of effects, as shown on
the Saving Throw Examples table.
Saving Throw Examples
Ability Make a Save To …
Strength Physically resist direct force
Dexterity Dodge out of harm’s way
Constitution Endure a toxic hazard
Intelligence Recognize an illusion as fake
Wisdom Resist a mental assault
Charisma Assert your identity
Proficiency Bonus
You add your Proficiency Bonus to your saving
throw if you have proficiency in that kind of save.
See “Proficiency” later in “Playing the Game.”
Difficulty Class
The Difficulty Class for a saving throw is deter-
mined by the effect that causes it or by the GM. For
example, if a spell forces you to make a save, the DC
is determined by the caster’s spellcasting ability
and Proficiency Bonus. Monster abilities that call
for saves specify the DC.
Attack Rolls
An attack roll determines whether an attack hits
a target. An attack roll hits if the roll equals or
exceeds the target’s Armor Class. Attack rolls usu-
ally occur in battle, described in “Combat” later in
“Playing the Game,” but the GM might also ask for
an attack roll in other situations, such as an archery
competition.
Ability Modifier
The Attack Roll Abilities table shows which ability
modifier to use for different types of attack rolls.
Attack Roll Abilities
Ability Attack Type
Strength Melee attack with a weapon or an Un-
armed Strike (see “Rules Glossary”)
Dexterity Ranged attack with a weapon
Varies Spell attack (the ability used is determined
by the spellcaster’s spellcasting feature, as
explained in “Spells”)
Some features let you use different ability modifiers
from those listed. For example, the Finesse property
(see “Equipment”) lets you use Strength or Dexter-
ity with a weapon that has that property.
Proficiency Bonus
You add your Proficiency Bonus to your attack roll
when you attack using a weapon you have profi-
ciency with, as well as when you attack with a spell.
See “Proficiency” later in “Playing the Game” for
more information about weapon proficiencies.
Armor Class
A creature’s Armor Class represents how well the
creature avoids being wounded in combat. The AC
of a character is determined at character creation
(see “Character Creation”), whereas the AC of a
monster appears in its stat block.
Calculating AC. All creatures start with the same
base AC calculation:
Base AC = 10 + the creature’s Dexterity modifier
A creature’s AC can then be modified by armor,
magic items, spells, and more.
Only One Base AC. Some spells and class features
give characters a different way to calculate their AC.
A character with multiple features that give differ-
ent ways to calculate AC must choose which one to
use; only one base calculation can be in effect for a
creature.
Rolling 20 or 1
If you roll a 20 on the d20 (called a “natural 20”) for
an attack roll, the attack hits regardless of any mod-
ifiers or the target’s AC. This is called a Critical Hit
(see “Combat” later in “Playing the Game”).
If you roll a 1 on the d20 (a “natural 1”) for an at-
tack roll, the attack misses regardless of any modifi-
ers or the target’s AC.
Advantage/Disadvantage
Sometimes a D20 Test is modified by Advantage or
Disadvantage. Advantage reflects the positive cir-
cumstances surrounding a d20 roll, while Disadvan-
tage reflects negative circumstances.
You usually acquire Advantage or Disadvantage
through the use of special abilities and actions. The

HEroic inspiration
Sometimes the GM or a rule gives you Heroic Inspira-
tion. If you have Heroic Inspiration, you can expend it
to reroll any die immediately after rolling it, and you
must use the new roll.
Only One at a Time. You can never have more
than one instance of Heroic Inspiration. If something
gives you Heroic Inspiration and you already have it,
you can give it to a player character in your group
who lacks it.
Gaining Heroic Inspiration. Your GM can
give you Heroic Inspiration for a variety of reasons.
Typically, GMs award it when you do something par-
ticularly heroic, in character, or entertaining. It’s a
reward for making the game more fun for everyone
playing.
Other rules might allow your character to gain
Heroic Inspiration independent of the GM’s decision.
For example, Human characters start each day with
Heroic Inspiration.
GM can also decide that circumstances grant Ad-
vantage or impose Disadvantage.
Roll Two D20s
When a roll has either Advantage or Disadvantage,
roll a second d20 when you make the roll. Use the
higher of the two rolls if you have Advantage, and
use the lower roll if you have Disadvantage. For ex-
ample, if you have Disadvantage and roll an 18 and a
3, use the 3. If you instead have Advantage and roll
those numbers, use the 18.
They Don’t Stack
If multiple situations affect a roll and they all grant
Advantage on it, you still roll only two d20s. Simi-
larly, if multiple situations impose Disadvantage on
a roll, you roll only two d20s.
If circumstances cause a roll to have both Advan-
tage and Disadvantage, the roll has neither of them,
and you roll one d20. This is true even if multiple
circumstances impose Disadvantage and only one
grants Advantage or vice versa. In such a situation,
you have neither Advantage nor Disadvantage.
Interactions with Rerolls
When you have Advantage or Disadvantage and
something in the game lets you reroll or replace the
d20, you can reroll or replace only one die, not both.
You choose which one.
For example, if you have Heroic Inspiration (see
the sidebar below) and roll a 3 and an 18 on an abil-
ity check that has Advantage or Disadvantage, you
could expend your Heroic Inspiration to reroll one
of those dice, not both of them.
Proficiency
Characters and monsters are good at various
things. Some are skilled with many weapons, while
others can use only a few. Some are better at under-
standing people’s motives, and others are better at
unlocking the secrets of the multiverse. All crea-
tures have a Proficiency Bonus, which reflects the
impact that training has on the creature’s capabil-
ities. A character’s Proficiency Bonus increases as
the character gains levels (described in “Character
Creation”). A monster’s Proficiency Bonus is based
on its Challenge Rating (see “Rules Glossary”). The
Proficiency Bonus table shows how the bonus is
determined.
This bonus is applied to a D20 Test when the crea-
ture has proficiency in a skill, in a saving throw, or
with an item that the creature uses to make the D20
Test. The bonus is also used for spell attacks and for
calculating the DC of saving throws for spells.
Proficiency Bonus
Level or CR Bonus
Up to 4 +2
5–8 +3
9–12 +4
13–16 +5
Level or CR Bonus
17–20 +6
21–24 +7
25–28 +8
29–30 +9
The Bonus Doesn’t Stack
Your Proficiency Bonus can’t be added to a die roll
or another number more than once. For example, if
a rule allows you to make a Charisma (Deception or
Persuasion) check, you add your Proficiency Bonus
if you’re proficient in either skill, but you don’t add
it twice if you’re proficient in both skills.
Occasionally, a Proficiency Bonus might be mul-
tiplied or divided (doubled or halved, for example)
before being added. For example, the Expertise
feature (see “Rules Glossary”) doubles the Profi-
ciency Bonus for certain ability checks. Whenever
the bonus is used, it can be multiplied only once and
divided only once.
Skill Proficiencies
Most ability checks involve using a skill, which rep-
resents a category of things creatures try to do with
an ability check. The descriptions of the actions
you take (see “Actions” later in “Playing the Game”)
specify which skill applies if you make an ability
check for that action, and many other rules note
when a skill is relevant. The GM has the ultimate say
on whether a skill is relevant in a situation.
If a creature is proficient in a skill, the creature
applies its Proficiency Bonus to ability checks in-
volving that skill. Without proficiency in a skill, a
creature can still make ability checks involving

that skill but doesn’t add its Proficiency Bonus. For
example, if a character tries to climb a cliff, the GM
might ask for a Strength (Athletics) check. If the
character has Athletics proficiency, the character
adds their Proficiency Bonus to the Strength check.
If the character lacks that proficiency, they make
the check without adding their Proficiency Bonus.
Skill List
The skills are shown on the Skills table, which notes
example uses for each skill proficiency as well as
the ability check the skill most often applies to.
Determining Skills
A character’s starting skill proficiencies are deter-
mined at character creation, and a monster’s skill
proficiencies appear in its stat block.
Saving Throw Proficiencies
Proficiency in a saving throw lets a character add
their Proficiency Bonus to saves that use a partic-
ular ability. For example, proficiency in Wisdom
saves lets you add your Proficiency Bonus to your
Wisdom saves. Some monsters also have saving
throw proficiencies, as noted in their stat blocks.
Each class gives proficiency in at least two saving
throws, representing that class’s training in evading
or resisting certain threats. Wizards, for example,
are proficient in Intelligence and Wisdom saves;
they train to resist mental assault.
Equipment Proficiencies
A character gains proficiency with various weapons
and tools from their class and background. There
are two categories of equipment proficiency:
Weapons. Anyone can wield a weapon, but profi-
ciency makes you better at wielding it. If you have
proficiency with a weapon, you add your Profi-
ciency Bonus to attack rolls you make with it.
Tools. If you have proficiency with a tool, you can
add your Proficiency Bonus to any ability check
you make that uses the tool. If you have profi-
ciency in the skill that’s also used with that check,
you have Advantage on the check too. This means
you can benefit from both skill proficiency and
tool proficiency on the same ability check.
Actions
When you do something other than moving or com-
municating, you typically take an action. The Action
table lists the game’s main actions, which are de-
fined in more detail in “Rules Glossary.”
Actions
Action Summary
Attack Attack with a weapon or an Unarmed
Strike.
Dash For the rest of the turn, give yourself extra
movement equal to your Speed.

tunity Attacks for the rest of the turn.
Dodge Until the start of your next turn, attack
rolls against you have Disadvantage, and
you make Dexterity saving throws with
Advantage. You lose this benefit if you
have the Incapacitated condition or if your
Speed is 0.
Help Help another creature’s ability check or
attack roll, or administer first aid.
Hide Make a Dexterity (Stealth) check.
Influence Make a Charisma (Deception, Intimidation,
Performance, or Persuasion) or Wisdom
(Animal Handling) check to alter a crea-
ture’s attitude.
Magic Cast a spell, use a magic item, or use a
magical feature.
Ready Prepare to take an action in response to a
trigger you define.
Search Make a Wisdom (Insight, Medicine,
Perception, or Survival) check.
Study Make an Intelligence (Arcana, History, In-
vestigation, Nature, or Religion) check.
Utilize Use a nonmagical object.
Player characters and monsters can also do things
not covered by these actions. Many class features
and other abilities provide additional action op-
tions, and you can improvise other actions. When
you describe an action not detailed elsewhere in the
rules, the Game Master tells you whether that action
is possible and what kind of D20 Test you need to
make, if any.
One Thing at a Time
The game uses actions to govern how much you can
do at one time. You can take only one action at a
time. This principle is most important in combat, as
explained in “Combat” later in “Playing the Game.”
Actions can come up in other situations, too: in a
social interaction, you can try to Influence a crea-
ture or use the Search action to read the creature’s
body language, but you can’t do both at the same
time. And when you’re exploring a dungeon, you
can’t simultaneously use the Search action to look
for traps and use the Help action to aid another
character who’s trying to open a stuck door (with
the Utilize action).
Bonus Actions
Various class features, spells, and other abilities let
you take an additional action on your turn called
a Bonus Action. The Cunning Action feature, for
example, allows a Rogue to take a Bonus Action. You
can take a Bonus Action only when a special ability,
a spell, or another feature of the game states that
you can do something as a Bonus Action. You other-
wise don’t have a Bonus Action to take.
You can take only one Bonus Action on your turn,
so you must choose which Bonus Action to use if you
have more than one available.
You choose when to take a Bonus Action during
your turn unless the Bonus Action’s timing is spec-
ified. Anything that deprives you of your ability to
take actions also prevents you from taking a Bonus
Action.
Reactions
Certain special abilities, spells, and situations al-
low you to take a special action called a Reaction. A
Reaction is an instant response to a trigger of some
kind, which can occur on your turn or on someone
else’s. The Opportunity Attack, described later in
“Playing the Game,” is the most common type of
Reaction.
When you take a Reaction, you can’t take another
one until the start of your next turn. If the reaction
interrupts another creature’s turn, that creature
can continue its turn right after the Reaction.
In terms of timing, a Reaction takes place immedi-
ately after its trigger unless the Reaction’s descrip-
tion says otherwise.
Social Interaction
During their adventures, player characters meet
many different people and face some monsters that
would rather talk than fight. In those situations, it’s
time for social interaction, which takes many forms.
For example, you might try to convince a burglar to
confess to wrongdoing or try to flatter a guard. The
Game Master assumes the roles of any nonplayer
characters who are participating.
An NPC’s attitude toward your character is
Friendly, Indifferent, or Hostile, as defined in “Rules
Glossary.” Friendly NPCs are predisposed to help,
and Hostile ones are inclined to hinder.
Social interactions progress in two ways: through
roleplaying and ability checks.
Roleplaying
Roleplaying is, literally, the act of playing out a role.
In this case, it’s you as a player determining how
your character thinks, acts, and talks. Roleplaying is
part of every aspect of the game, and it comes to the
fore during social interactions.
As you roleplay, consider whether you prefer an
active approach or a descriptive approach.
The GM uses an NPC’s personality and your char-
acter’s actions and attitudes to determine how an

NPC reacts. A cowardly bandit might buckle under
threats of imprisonment. A stubborn merchant
refuses to help if the characters badger her. A vain
dragon laps up flattery.
When interacting with an NPC, pay attention to
the GM’s portrayal of the NPC’s personality. You
might be able to learn an NPC’s goals and then use
that information to influence the NPC.
If you offer NPCs something they want or play
on their sympathies, fears, or goals, you can form
friendships, ward off violence, or learn a key piece
of information. On the other hand, if you insult a
proud warrior or speak ill of a noble’s allies, your
efforts to convince or deceive will likely fail.
Ability Checks
Ability checks can be key in determining the out-
come of a social interaction. Your roleplaying efforts
can alter an NPC’s attitude, but there might still be
an element of chance if the GM wants dice to play
a role in determining an NPC’s response to you. In
such situations, the GM will typically ask you to
take the Influence action.
Pay attention to your skill proficiencies when
thinking of how you will interact with an NPC; use
an approach that relies on your group’s skill pro-
ficiencies. For example, if the group needs to trick
a guard into letting them into a castle, the Rogue
who is proficient in Deception should lead the
discussion.
Exploration
Exploration involves delving into places that are
dangerous and full of mystery. The rules in this sec-
tion detail some of the ways adventurers interact
with the environment in such places.
Adventuring Equipment
As adventurers explore, their equipment can help
them in many ways. For example, they can reach
out-of-the-way places with a Ladder, perceive things
they wouldn’t otherwise notice with a Torch or
another light source, bypass locked doors and con-
tainers with Thieves’ Tools, and create obstacles for
pursuers with Caltrops.
See “Equipment” for rules on many items that are
useful on adventures. The items in the“Tools” and
“Adventuring Gear” sections are especially useful.
The weapons in “Equipment” can also be used for
more than battle; you could use a Quarterstaff,
for example, to push a sinister-looking button that
you’re reluctant to touch.
Vision and Light
Some adventuring tasks—such as noticing danger,
hitting an enemy, and targeting certain spells—are
affected by sight, so effects that obscure vision can
hinder you, as explained below.
Obscured Areas
An area might be Lightly or Heavily Obscured. In a
Lightly Obscured area—such as an area with Dim
Light, patchy fog, or moderate foliage—you have
Disadvantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that
rely on sight.
A Heavily Obscured area—such as an area with
Darkness, heavy fog, or dense foliage—is opaque.
You have the Blinded condition (see “Rules Glos-
sary”) when trying to see something there.
Light
The presence or absence of light determines the cat-
egory of illumination in an area, as defined below.
Bright Light. Bright Light lets most creatures see
normally. Even gloomy days provide Bright Light, as
do torches, lanterns, fires, and other sources of illu-
mination within a specific radius.
Dim Light. Dim Light, also called shadows, cre-
ates a Lightly Obscured area. An area of Dim Light
is usually a boundary between Bright Light and
surrounding Darkness. The soft light of twilight and
dawn also counts as Dim Light. A full moon might
bathe the land in Dim Light.
Darkness. Darkness creates a Heavily Obscured
area. Characters face Darkness outdoors at night
(even most moonlit nights), within the confines of
an unlit dungeon, or in an area of magical Darkness.
Special Senses
Some creatures have special senses that help them
perceive things in certain situations. “Rules Glos-
sary” defines the following special senses:
Blindsight
Darkvision
Tremorsense
Truesight
Hiding
Adventurers and monsters often hide, whether to
spy on one another, sneak past a guardian, or set an
ambush. The Game Master decides when circum-
stances are appropriate for hiding. When you try to
hide, you take the Hide action.
Interacting with Objects
Interacting with objects is often simple to resolve.
The player tells the GM that their character is do-
ing something, such as moving a lever or opening

M arcHinG ordEr
The adventurers should establish a marching order
while they travel, whether indoors or outdoors. A
marching order makes it easier to determine which
characters are affected by traps, which ones can spot
hidden enemies, and which ones are the closest to
those enemies if a fight breaks out. You can change
your marching order outside combat and record the
order any way you like: write it down, for example,
or arrange miniatures to show it.
a door, and the GM describes what happens. Some-
times, however, rules govern what you can do with
an object, as detailed in the following sections.
What Is an Object?
For the purpose of the rules, an object is a discrete,
inanimate item like a window, door, sword, book,
table, chair, or stone. It isn’t a building or a vehicle,
which are composed of many objects.
Time-Limited Object Interactions
When time is short, such as in combat, interactions
with objects are limited: one free interaction per
turn. That interaction must occur during a crea-
ture’s movement or action. Any additional inter-
actions require the Utilize action, as explained in
“Combat” later in “Playing the Game.”
Finding Hidden Objects
When your character searches for hidden things,
such as a secret door or a trap, the GM typically asks
you to make a Wisdom (Perception) check, provided
you describe the character searching in the hidden
object’s vicinity. On a success, you find the object,
other important details, or both.
If you describe your character searching nowhere
near a hidden object, a Wisdom (Perception) check
won’t reveal the object, no matter the check’s total.
Carrying Objects
You can usually carry your gear and treasure with-
out worrying about the weight of those objects. If
you try to haul an unusually heavy object or a mas-
sive number of lighter objects, the GM might require
you to abide by the rules for carrying capacity in
“Rules Glossary.”
Breaking Objects
As an action, you can automatically break or oth-
erwise destroy a fragile, nonmagical object, such
as a glass container or a piece of paper. If you try to
damage something more resilient, the GM might use
the rules on breaking objects in “Rules Glossary.”
Hazards
Monsters are the main perils characters face, but
other dangers await. “Rules Glossary” defines the
following hazards:
Burning
Dehydration
Falling
Malnutrition
Suffocation
Travel
During an adventure, the characters might travel
long distances on trips that could take hours or
days. The GM can summarize this travel without
calculating exact distances or travel times, or the
GM might have you use the travel pace rules below.
If you need to know how fast you can move when
every second matters, see the movement rules in
“Combat” later in “Playing the Game.”
Travel Pace
While traveling outside combat, a group can move
at a Fast, Normal, or Slow pace, as shown on the
Travel Pace table. The table states how far the
party can move in a period of time; if riding horses
or other mounts, the group can move twice that
distance for 1 hour, after which the mounts need a
Short or Long Rest before they can move at that in-
creased pace again (see “Equipment” for a selection
of mounts for sale). “Gameplay Toolbox” has rules
that affect which pace you can choose in certain
types of terrain.
Travel Pace
Pace
Distance Traveled Per …
Minute Hour Day
Fast 400 feet 4 miles 30 miles
Normal 300 feet 3 miles 24 miles
Slow 200 feet 2 miles 18 miles
Each travel pace has a game effect, as defined below.
Fast. Traveling at a Fast pace imposes Disadvan-
tage on a traveler’s Wisdom (Perception or Sur-
vival) and Dexterity (Stealth) checks.
Normal. Traveling at a Normal pace imposes Dis-
advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks.
Slow. Traveling at a Slow pace grants Advantage
on Wisdom (Perception or Survival) checks.
Vehicles
Travelers in wagons, carriages, or other land vehi-
cles choose a pace as normal. Characters in a water-
borne vessel are limited to the speed of the vessel,
and they don’t choose a travel pace. Depending on
the vessel and the size of the crew, ships might be
able to travel for up to 24 hours per day. “Equip-
ment” includes vehicles for sale.

playinG on a G rid
If you play using a square grid and miniatures or
other tokens, follow these rules.
Squares. Each square represents 5 feet.
Speed. Rather than moving foot by foot, move
square by square on the grid, using your Speed in
5-foot segments. You can translate your Speed into
squares by dividing it by 5. For example, a Speed of
30 feet translates into 6 squares. If you use a grid of-
ten, consider writing your Speed in squares on your
character sheet.
Entering a Square. To enter a square, you must
have enough movement left to pay for entering. It
costs 1 square of movement to enter an unoccupied
square that’s adjacent to your space (orthogonally
or diagonally adjacent). A square of Difficult Terrain
costs 2 squares to enter. Other effects might make a
square cost even more.
Corners. Diagonal movement can’t cross the cor-
ner of a wall, a large tree, or another terrain feature
that fills its space.
Ranges. To determine the range on a grid be-
tween two things—whether creatures or objects—
count squares from a square adjacent to one of them
and stop counting in the space of the other one.
Count by the shortest route.
Combat
Adventurers encounter many dangerous monsters
and nefarious villains. In those moments, combat
often breaks out.
The Order of Combat
A typical combat encounter is a clash between two
sides: a flurry of weapon swings, feints, parries,
footwork, and spellcasting. The game organizes
combat into a cycle of rounds and turns. A round
represents about 6 seconds in the game world.
During a round, each participant in a battle takes a
turn. The order of turns is determined at the begin-
ning of combat when everyone rolls Initiative. Once
everyone has taken a turn, the fight continues to the
next round if neither side is defeated.
Combat Step by Step
Combat unfolds in these steps:
1: Establish Positions. The Game Master deter-
mines where all the characters and monsters are
located. Given the adventurers’ marching order
or their stated positions in the room or other lo-
cation, the GM figures out where the adversaries
are—how far away and in what direction.
2: Roll Initiative. Everyone involved in the combat
encounter rolls Initiative, determining the order
of combatants’ turns.
3: Take Turns. Each participant in the battle takes
a turn in Initiative order. When everyone in-
volved in the combat has had a turn, the round
ends. Repeat this step until the fighting stops.
Initiative
Initiative determines the order of turns during
combat. When combat starts, every participant
rolls Initiative; they make a Dexterity check that
determines their place in the Initiative order. The
GM rolls for monsters. For a group of identical crea-
tures, the GM makes a single roll, so each member of
the group has the same Initiative.
Surprise. If a combatant is surprised by combat
starting, that combatant has Disadvantage on their
Initiative roll. For example, if an ambusher starts
combat while hidden from a foe who is unaware
that combat is starting, that foe is surprised.
Initiative Order. A combatant’s check total is
called their Initiative count, or Initiative for short.
The GM ranks the combatants, from highest to
lowest Initiative. This is the order in which they act
during each round. The Initiative order remains the
same from round to round.
Ties. If a tie occurs, the GM decides the order
among tied monsters, and the players decide the
order among tied characters. The GM decides the
order if the tie is between a monster and a player
character.
Your Turn
On your turn, you can move a distance up to your
Speed and take one action. You decide whether to
move first or take your action first.
The main actions you can take are listed in “Ac-
tions” earlier in “Playing the Game.” A character’s
features and a monster’s stat block also provide
action options. “Movement and Position” later in
“Playing the Game” gives the rules for movement.
Communicating. You can communicate however
you are able—through brief utterances and ges-
tures—as you take your turn. Doing so uses neither
your action nor your move.
Extended communication, such as a detailed ex-
planation of something or an attempt to persuade a
foe, requires an action. The Influence action is the
main way you try to influence a monster.
Interacting with Things. You can interact with
one object or feature of the environment for free,
during either your move or action. For example, you
could open a door during your move as you stride
toward a foe.
If you want to interact with a second object, you
need to take the Utilize action. Some magic items
and other special objects always require an action
to use, as stated in their descriptions.

unsEEn attackErs and tarGEts
When you make an attack roll against a target you
can’t see, you have Disadvantage on the roll. This is
true whether you’re guessing the target’s location or
targeting a creature you can hear but not see. If the
target isn’t in the location you targeted, you miss.
When a creature can’t see you, you have Advantage
on attack rolls against it.
If you are hidden when you make an attack roll,
you give away your location when the attack hits or
misses.
The GM might require you to use an action for
any of these activities when it needs special care or
when it presents an unusual obstacle. For instance,
the GM might require you to take the Utilize action
to open a stuck door or turn a crank to lower a
drawbridge.
Doing Nothing on Your Turn. You can forgo mov-
ing, taking an action, or doing anything at all on
your turn. If you can’t decide what to do, consider
taking the defensive Dodge action or the Ready ac-
tion to delay acting.
Ending Combat
Combat ends when one side or the other is defeated,
which can mean the creatures are killed or knocked
out or have surrendered or fled. Combat can also
end when both sides agree to end it.
Movement and Position
On your turn, you can move a distance equal to your
Speed or less. Or you can decide not to move.
Your movement can include climbing, crawling,
jumping, and swimming (each explained in “Rules
Glossary”). These different modes of movement can
be combined with your regular movement, or they
can constitute your entire move.
However you’re moving with your Speed, you
deduct the distance of each part of your move from
it until it is used up or until you are done moving,
whichever comes first.
A character’s Speed is determined during char-
acter creation. A monster’s Speed is noted in the
monster’s stat block. See “Rules Glossary” for more
about Speed as well as about special speeds, such as
a Climb Speed, Fly Speed, or Swim Speed.
Difficult Terrain
Combatants are often slowed down by Difficult
Terrain. Low furniture, rubble, undergrowth, steep
stairs, snow, and shallow bogs are examples of Diffi-
cult Terrain.
Every foot of movement in Difficult Terrain costs
1 extra foot, even if multiple things in a space count
as Difficult Terrain.
Breaking Up Your Move
You can break up your move, using some of its
movement before and after any action, Bonus Ac-
tion, or Reaction you take on the same turn. For
example, if you have a Speed of 30 feet, you could go
10 feet, take an action, and then go 20 feet.
Dropping Prone
On your turn, you can give yourself the Prone condi-
tion (see “Rules Glossary”) without using an action
or any of your Speed, but you can’t do so if your
Speed is 0.
Creature Size
A creature belongs to a size category, which deter-
mines the width of the square space the creature
occupies on a map, as shown on the Creature Size
and Space table. That table lists the sizes from
smallest (Tiny) to largest (Gargantuan). A creature’s
space is the area that it effectively controls in com-
bat and the area it needs to fight effectively.
A character’s size is determined by species, and
a monster’s size is specified in the monster’s stat
block.
Creature Size and Space
Size Space (Feet) Space (Squares)
Tiny 2½ by 2½ feet 4 per square
Small 5 by 5 feet 1 square
Medium 5 by 5 feet 1 square
Large 10 by 10 feet 4 squares (2 by 2)
Huge 15 by 15 feet 9 squares (3 by 3)
Gargantuan 20 by 20 feet 16 squares (4 by 4)
Moving around Other Creatures
During your move, you can pass through the space
of an ally, a creature that has the Incapacitated
condition (see “Rules Glossary”), a Tiny creature, or
a creature that is two sizes larger or smaller than
you.
Another creature’s space is Difficult Terrain for
you unless that creature is Tiny or your ally.
You can’t willingly end a move in a space occupied
by another creature. If you somehow end a turn in
a space with another creature, you have the Prone
condition (see “Rules Glossary”) unless you are Tiny
or are of a larger size than the other creature.
Making an Attack
When you take the Attack action, you make an
attack. Some other actions, Bonus Actions, and Re-
actions also let you make an attack. Whether you
strike with a Melee weapon, fire a Ranged weapon,

or make an attack roll as part of a spell, an attack
has the following structure:
1: Choose a Target. Pick a target within your at-
tack’s range: a creature, an object, or a location.
2: Determine Modifiers. The GM determines
whether the target has Cover (see the next sec-
tion) and whether you have Advantage or Dis-
advantage against the target. In addition, spells,
special abilities, and other effects can apply pen-
alties or bonuses to your attack roll.
3: Resolve the Attack. Make the attack roll, as
detailed earlier in “Playing the Game.” On a hit,
you roll damage unless the particular attack
has rules that specify otherwise. Some attacks
cause special effects in addition to or instead of
damage.
Cover
Walls, trees, creatures, and other obstacles can pro-
vide cover, making a target more difficult to harm.
As detailed in the Cover table, there are three de-
grees of cover, each of which gives a different bene-
fit to a target.
A target can benefit from cover only when an at-
tack or other effect originates on the opposite side
of the cover. If a target is behind multiple sources
of cover, only the most protective degree of cover
applies; the degrees aren’t added together. For ex-
ample, if a target is behind a creature that gives Half
Cover and a tree trunk that gives Three-Quarters
Cover, the target has Three-Quarters Cover.
Cover

an object that covers at
least half of the target
Three-
Quarters
+5 bonus to AC
and Dexterity
saving throws
An object that covers at
least three-quarters of
the target
Total Can’t be targeted
directly
An object that covers
the whole target
Ranged Attacks
When you make a ranged attack, you fire a bow,
hurl an axe, or otherwise send projectiles to strike a
foe at a distance. Many spells also involve making a
ranged attack.
Range
You can make ranged attacks only against targets
within a specified range. If a ranged attack, such as
one made with a spell, has a single range, you can’t
attack a target beyond this range.
Some ranged attacks, such as those made with a
Longbow, have two ranges. The smaller number is
the normal range, and the larger number is the long
range. Your attack roll has Disadvantage when your
target is beyond normal range, and you can’t attack
a target beyond long range.
Ranged Attacks in Close Combat
Aiming a ranged attack is more difficult when a foe
is next to you. When you make a ranged attack roll
with a weapon, a spell, or some other means, you
have Disadvantage on the roll if you are within 5
feet of an enemy who can see you and doesn’t have
the Incapacitated condition (see “Rules Glossary”).
Melee Attacks
A melee attack allows you to attack a target within
your reach. A melee attack typically uses a hand-
held weapon or an Unarmed Strike. Many monsters
make melee attacks with claws, teeth, or other body
parts. A few spells also involve melee attacks.
Reach
A creature has a 5-foot reach and can thus attack
targets within 5 feet when making a melee attack.
Certain creatures have melee attacks with a reach
greater than 5 feet, as noted in their descriptions.
Opportunity Attacks
Combatants watch for enemies to drop their guard.
If you move heedlessly past your foes, you put your-
self in danger by provoking an Opportunity Attack.
Avoiding Opportunity Attacks. You can avoid
provoking an Opportunity Attack by taking the
Disengage action. You also don’t provoke an Oppor-
tunity Attack when you Teleport or when you are
moved without using your movement, action, Bonus
Action, or Reaction. For example, you don’t provoke
an Opportunity Attack if an explosion hurls you out
of a foe’s reach or if you fall past an enemy.
Making an Opportunity Attack. You can make an
Opportunity Attack when a creature that you can
see leaves your reach. To make the attack, take a Re-
action to make one melee attack with a weapon or
an Unarmed Strike against that creature. The attack
occurs right before it leaves your reach.
Mounted Combat
A willing creature that is at least one size larger
than a rider and that has an appropriate anatomy
can serve as a mount, using the following rules.
Mounting and Dismounting
During your move, you can mount a creature that
is within 5 feet of you or dismount. Doing so costs
an amount of movement equal to half your Speed
(round down). For example, if your Speed is 30 feet,
you spend 15 feet of movement to mount a horse.

rEstinG
Adventurers can’t spend every hour adventuring.
They need rest. Any creature can take hour-long
Short Rests in the midst of a day and an 8-hour Long
Rest to end it. Regaining Hit Points is one of the main
benefits of a rest. “Rules Glossary” provides the
rules for Short and Long Rests.
Controlling a Mount
You can control a mount only if it has been trained
to accept a rider. Domesticated horses, mules, and
similar creatures have such training.
The Initiative of a controlled mount changes to
match yours when you mount it. It moves on your
turn as you direct it, and it has only three action op-
tions during that turn: Dash, Disengage, and Dodge.
A controlled mount can move and act even on the
turn that you mount it.
In contrast, an independent mount—one that lets
you ride but ignores your control—retains its place
in the Initiative order and moves and acts as it likes.
Falling Off
If an effect is about to move your mount against its
will while you’re on it, you must succeed on a DC 10
Dexterity saving throw or fall off, landing with the
Prone condition (see “Rules Glossary”) in an unoc-
cupied space within 5 feet of the mount.
While mounted, you must make the same save if
you’re knocked Prone or the mount is.
Underwater Combat
A fight underwater follows these rules.
Impeded Weapons
When making a melee attack roll with a weapon
underwater, a creature that lacks a Swim Speed has
Disadvantage on the attack roll unless the weapon
deals Piercing damage.
A ranged attack roll with a weapon underwater
automatically misses a target beyond the weapon’s
normal range, and the attack roll has Disadvantage
against a target within normal range.
Fire Resistance
Anything underwater has Resistance to Fire dam-
age (explained in “Damage and Healing”).
Damage and Healing
Injury and death are frequent threats, as detailed in
the following rules.
Hit Points
Hit Points represent durability and the will to live.
Creatures with more Hit Points are more difficult
to kill. Your Hit Point maximum is the number of
Hit Points you have when uninjured. Your current
Hit Points can be any number from that maximum
down to 0, which is the lowest Hit Points can go.
Whenever you take damage, subtract it from your
Hit Points. Hit Point loss has no effect on your capa-
bilities until you reach 0 Hit Points.
If you have half your Hit Points or fewer, you’re
Bloodied, which has no game effect on its own but
which might trigger other game effects.
Damage Rolls
Each weapon, spell, and damaging monster ability
specifies the damage it deals. You roll the damage
dice, add any modifiers, and deal the damage to
your target. If there’s a penalty to the damage, it’s
possible to deal 0 damage but not negative damage.
When attacking with a weapon, you add your abil-
ity modifier—the same modifier used for the attack
roll—to the damage roll. A spell tells you which dice
to roll for damage and whether to add any modi-
fiers. Unless a rule says otherwise, you don’t add
your ability modifier to a fixed damage amount that
doesn’t use a roll, such as the damage of a Blowgun.
See “Equipment” for weapons’ damage dice and
“Spells” for spells’ damage dice.
Critical Hits
When you score a Critical Hit, you deal extra dam-
age. Roll the attack’s damage dice twice, add them
together, and add any relevant modifiers as normal.
For example, if you score a Critical Hit with a Dag-
ger, roll 2d4 for the damage rather than 1d4, and
add your relevant ability modifier. If the attack in-
volves other damage dice, such as from the Rogue’s
Sneak Attack feature, you also roll those dice twice.
Saving Throws and Damage
Damage dealt via saving throws uses these rules.
Damage against Multiple Targets
When you create a damaging effect that forces two
or more targets to make saving throws against it at
the same time, roll the damage once for all the tar-
gets. For example, when a wizard casts Fireball, the
spell’s damage is rolled once for all creatures caught
in the blast.
Half Damage
Many saving throw effects deal half damage (round
down) to a target when the target succeeds on the
saving throw. The halved damage is equal to half
the damage that would be dealt on a failed save.
Damage Types
Each instance of damage has a type, like Fire
or Slashing. Damage types are listed in “Rules

knockinG out a crEaturE
When you would reduce a creature to 0 Hit Points
with a melee attack, you can instead reduce the crea-
ture to 1 Hit Point and give it the Unconscious condi-
tion. It then starts a Short Rest, at the end of which
that condition ends on it. The condition ends early
if the creature regains any Hit Points or if someone
takes an action to administer first aid to it, making a
successful DC 10 Wisdom (Medicine) check.
Glossary” and have no rules of their own, but other
rules, such as Resistance, rely on damage types.
Resistance and Vulnerability
Some creatures and objects have Resistance or
Vulnerability to certain damage types. If you have
Resistance to a damage type, damage of that type
is halved against you (round down). If you have
Vulnerability to a damage type, damage of that type
is doubled against you. For example, if you have
Resistance to Cold damage, such damage is halved
against you, and if you have Vulnerability to Fire
damage, such damage is doubled against you.
No Stacking
Multiple instances of Resistance or Vulnerability
that affect the same damage type count as only one
instance. For example, if you have Resistance to Ne-
crotic damage as well as Resistance to all damage,
Necrotic damage is reduced by half against you.
Order of Application
Modifiers to damage are applied in the following
order: adjustments such as bonuses, penalties, or
multipliers are applied first; Resistance is applied
second; and Vulnerability is applied third.
For example, a creature has Resistance to all dam-
age and Vulnerability to Fire damage, and it’s within
a magical aura that reduces all damage by 5. If it
takes 28 Fire damage, the damage is first reduced
by 5 (to 23), then halved for the creature’s Resis-
tance (and rounded down to 11), then doubled for
its Vulnerability (to 22).
Immunity
Some creatures and objects have Immunity to cer-
tain damage types and conditions. Immunity to a
damage type means you don’t take damage of that
type, and Immunity to a condition means you aren’t
affected by it.
Healing
Hit Points can be restored by magic, such as the
Cure Wounds spell or a Potion of Healing, or by a
Short or Long Rest (see “Rules Glossary”).
When you receive healing, add the restored Hit
Points to your current Hit Points. Your Hit Points
can’t exceed your Hit Point maximum, so any Hit
Points regained in excess of the maximum are lost.
For example, if you receive 8 Hit Points of healing
and have 14 Hit Points and a Hit Point maximum of
20, you regain 6 Hit Points, not 8.
Dropping to 0 Hit Points
When a creature drops to 0 Hit Points, it either dies
outright or falls unconscious, as explained below.
Instant Death
Here are the main ways a creature can die instantly.
Monster Death. A monster dies the instant it
drops to 0 Hit Points, although a Game Master can
ignore this rule for an individual monster and treat
it like a character.
Hit Point Maximum of 0. A creature dies if its Hit
Point maximum reaches 0. Certain effects drain life
energy, reducing a creature’s Hit Point maximum.
Massive Damage. When damage reduces a char-
acter to 0 Hit Points and damage remains, the char-
acter dies if the remainder equals or exceeds their
Hit Point maximum. For example, if your character
has a Hit Point maximum of 12, currently has 6 Hit
Points, and takes 18 damage, the character drops to
0 Hit Points, but 12 damage remains. The character
then dies, since 12 equals their Hit Point maximum.
Character Demise
If your character dies, others might find a magical
way to revive your character, such as with the Raise
Dead spell. Or talk with the GM about making a new
character to join the group. “Rules Glossary” has
more information on being dead.
Falling Unconscious
If you reach 0 Hit Points and don’t die instantly, you
have the Unconscious condition (see “Rules Glos-
sary”) until you regain any Hit Points, and you now
face making Death Saving Throws (see below).
Death Saving Throws
Whenever you start your turn with 0 Hit Points,
you must make a Death Saving Throw to determine
whether you creep closer to death or hang on to life.
Unlike other saving throws, this one isn’t tied to an
ability score. You’re in the hands of fate now.
Three Successes/Failures. Roll 1d20. If the roll
is 10 or higher, you succeed. Otherwise, you fail. A
success or failure has no effect by itself. On your
third success, you become Stable (see “Stabilizing a
Character” below). On your third failure, you die.
The successes and failures don’t need to be con-
secutive; keep track of both until you collect three
of a kind. The number of both is reset to zero when
you regain any Hit Points or become Stable.

Rolling a 1 or 20. When you roll a 1 on the d20
for a Death Saving Throw, you suffer two failures. If
you roll a 20 on the d20, you regain 1 Hit Point.
Damage at 0 Hit Points. If you take any damage
while you have 0 Hit Points, you suffer a Death Sav-
ing Throw failure. If the damage is from a Critical
Hit, you suffer two failures instead. If the damage
equals or exceeds your Hit Point maximum, you die.
Stabilizing a Character
You can take the Help action to try to stabilize a
creature with 0 Hit Points, which requires a suc-
cessful DC 10 Wisdom (Medicine) check.
A Stable creature doesn’t make Death Saving
Throws even though it has 0 Hit Points, but it still
has the Unconscious condition. If the creature takes
damage, it stops being Stable and starts making
Death Saving Throws again. A Stable creature that
isn’t healed regains 1 Hit Point after 1d4 hours.
Temporary Hit Points
Some spells and other effects confer Temporary Hit
Points, which are a buffer against losing actual Hit
Points, as explained below.
Lose Temporary Hit Points First
If you have Temporary Hit Points and take damage,
those points are lost first, and any leftover damage
carries over to your Hit Points. For example, if you
have 5 Temporary Hit Points and take 7 damage,
you lose those points and then lose 2 Hit Points.
Duration
Temporary Hit Points last until they’re depleted or
you finish a Long Rest (see “Rules Glossary”).
They Don’t Stack
Temporary Hit Points can’t be added together. If
you have Temporary Hit Points and receive more
of them, you decide whether to keep the ones you
have or to gain the new ones. For example, if a spell
grants you 12 Temporary Hit Points when you al-
ready have 10, you can have 12 or 10, not 22.
They’re Not Hit Points or Healing
Temporary Hit Points can’t be added to your Hit
Points, healing can’t restore them, and receiving
Temporary Hit Points doesn’t count as healing. Be-
cause Temporary Hit Points aren’t Hit Points, a crea-
ture can be at full Hit Points and receive Temporary
Hit Points.
If you have 0 Hit Points, receiving Temporary Hit
Points doesn’t restore you to consciousness. Only
true healing can save you.

Character
Creation
Choose a Character Sheet
You’ll record the main details of your character on
a character sheet. Throughout this chapter, we use
the term “character sheet” to mean whatever you
use to track your character’s details, whether it’s a
printed character sheet, a digital character sheet, or
plain paper. Choose whichever style of sheet works
for you, and then embark on creating a character!
Create Your Character
Here are the steps to make a character; each step is
explored in detail:
1: Choose a Class. Every adventurer is a member
of a class. A class broadly describes a character’s
vocation, special talents, and favored tactics.
2: Determine Origin. A character’s origin includes
two elements: background and species. How did
the character spend the years leading up to a life
of adventure? Who are the character’s ancestors?
You can also choose your character’s languages.
3: Determine Ability Scores. Much of what your
character does in the game depends on the char-
acter’s six abilities.
4: Choose an Alignment. Alignment is a shorthand
for your character’s moral compass.
5: Fill in Details. Using the choices you’ve made, fill
in the remaining details on your character sheet.
Step 1: Choose Class
Choose a class, and write it on your character sheet.
The Class Overview table summarizes the classes.
See “Classes” for the classes’ details.

Write Your Level
Write your character’s level on your character
sheet. Typically, a character starts at level 1 and
advances in level by adventuring and gaining Expe-
rience Points (XP).
Write Your XP. Also record your Experience
Points. A level 1 character has 0 XP.
Starting at a Higher Level. Your GM might start
you at a higher level. If you start at level 3 or higher,
write your chosen subclass on your character sheet.
See the “Starting at Higher Levels” section later in
“Character Creation” for more information.
Note Armor Training
Your class might give you training with certain
categories of armor. Note your armor training on
your character sheet. Armor training with a kind of
armor means you can wear that armor effectively,
gaining defensive bonuses from it. The categories of
armor are described in “Equipment.”
Step 2: Character Origin
Determining your character’s origin involves choos-
ing a background, a species, and two languages.
A character’s background represents the place
and occupation that were most formative for the
character. The combination of background, species,
and languages provides fertile soil for your imagi-
nation as you ponder your character’s earliest days.
Choose a Background
Choose your character’s background, and write it on
your character sheet. You can choose any of the back-
grounds detailed in “Character Origins,” and your GM
might offer additional backgrounds as options.
The background you choose influences step 3,
when you determine your character’s ability scores.
If you’re having trouble choosing, the Ability Scores
and Backgrounds table shows which backgrounds
benefit which ability scores. Look for your class’s
primary ability there.
Ability Scores and Backgrounds
Ability Background
Strength Soldier
Dexterity Soldier
Constitution Soldier
Intelligence Acolyte

Ability Background
Wisdom Acolyte
Charisma Acolyte
Record Your Feat. A background gives you a feat,
which grants your character particular capabilities.
Feats are detailed in “Feats.” Write the feat on your
character sheet.
Note Proficiencies. Your background gives profi-
ciency in two skills and with one tool. Record this
information on your character sheet.
Your class also gives proficiencies. Check your
class description in “Classes” and note the proficien-
cies on your character sheet.
The features table in your class description shows
your Proficiency Bonus (described in “Playing the
Game”), which is +2 for a level 1 character. Note this
number on your character sheet. You’ll fill in other
numbers connected to these proficiencies in step 5.
Choose Starting Equipment
Your background and class both provide starting
equipment. Any coins that you gain at this step
can be immediately spent on equipment from
“Equipment.”
Record your chosen equipment on your character
sheet. Equipment is described in “Equipment,” but
for now you can just write it all down and look up
the specifics in “Equipment” later. Note any coins
you have left after purchasing your equipment.
Choose a Species
Choose a species for your character. The following
species options are detailed in “Character Origins”:
Dragonborn, Dwarf, Elf, Gnome, Goliath, Halfling,
Human, Orc, and Tiefling. Once you’ve chosen a spe-
cies, write it on your character sheet. Then record
your species’ traits.
Your character’s size and Speed are determined
by the character’s species; record these in the ap-
propriate places on your character sheet as well
(you may write just the first letter of your size).
Imagine Your Past and Present
Let your character’s background and species inspire
how you imagine their past. That past fed into the
character’s present. With that in mind, consider an-
swers to the following questions as your character:
• Who raised you?
• Who was your dearest childhood friend?
• Did you grow up with a pet?
• Have you fallen in love? If so, with whom?
• Did you join an organization, such as a guild or re-
ligion? If so, are you still a member of it?
• What elements of your past inspire you to go on
adventures now?
Choose Languages
Your character knows at least three languages:
Common plus two languages you roll or choose
from the Standard Languages table. Knowledge of a
language means your character can communicate in
it, read it, and write it. Your class and other features
might also give you languages.
The Standard Languages table lists languages that
are widespread in the setting. Every player charac-
ter knows Common. The other standard languages
originated with the first members of the most
prominent species in the setting and have since
spread widely.
Standard Languages
1d12 Language
— Common
1 Common Sign Language
2 Draconic
3–4 Dwarvish
5–6 Elvish
7 Giant
8 Gnomish
9 Goblin
10–11 Halfling
12 Orc
The Rare Languages table lists languages that are
either secret or derived from other planes of exis-
tence and thus less widespread in the worlds of the
Material Plane. Some features let a character learn a
rare language.
Rare Languages
Language Language
Abyssal Primordial*
Celestial Sylvan
Deep Speech Thieves’ Cant
Druidic Undercommon
Infernal
*Primordial includes the Aquan, Auran, Ignan, and Terran dialects.
Creatures that know one of these dialects can communicate with
those that know a different one.
Step 3: Ability Scores
To determine your character’s ability scores, you
first generate a set of six numbers using the instruc-
tions below and then assign them to your six abili-
ties. “Playing the Game” explains what each ability
means.

Generate Your Scores
Determine your ability scores by using one of the
following three methods. Your GM might prefer you
to use a particular one.
Standard Array. Use the following six scores for
your abilities: 15, 14, 13, 12, 10, 8.
Random Generation. Roll four d6s and record
the total of the highest three dice. Do this five more
times, so you have six numbers.
Point Cost. You have 27 points to spend on your
ability scores. The cost of each score is shown on
the Ability Score Point Costs table. For example, a
score of 14 costs 7 of your 27 points.
Ability Score Point Costs
Score Cost
8 0
9 1
10 2
11 3
Score Cost
12 4
13 5
14 7
15 9
Assign Ability Scores
Once you’ve generated six scores, assign them to
Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, Intelligence, Wis-
dom, and Charisma, keeping in mind your class’s
primary ability. Fill in the ability modifiers as well.
If you’re using the Standard Array option, consult
the Standard Array by Class table for suggestions
on where to assign scores for your character’s class.
The table puts the highest scores in a class’s main
abilities. If you used a different method to gener-
ate the scores, you may still use this table to guide
where you place your highest and lowest scores.
Standard Array by Class
Class Str. Dex. Con. Int. Wis. Cha.
Barbarian 15 13 14 10 12 8
Bard 8 14 12 13 10 15
Cleric 14 8 13 10 15 12
Druid 8 12 14 13 15 10
Fighter 15 14 13 8 10 12
Monk 12 15 13 10 14 8
Paladin 15 10 13 8 12 14
Ranger 12 15 13 8 14 10
Rogue 12 15 13 14 10 8
Sorcerer 10 13 14 8 12 15
Warlock 8 14 13 12 10 15
Wizard 8 12 13 15 14 10
Adjust Ability Scores
After assigning your ability scores, adjust them ac-
cording to your background. Your background lists
three abilities; increase one of those scores by 2 and
a different one by 1, or increase all three by 1. None
of these increases can raise a score above 20.
Some players like to increase their class’s primary
ability, while others prefer to increase a low score.
Determine Ability Modifiers
Finally, determine your ability modifiers using the
Ability Scores and Modifiers table. Write the modi-
fier next to each of your scores.
Ability Scores and Modifiers
Score Modifier
3 −4
4–5 −3
6–7 −2
8–9 −1
10–11 +0
Score Modifier
12–13 +1
14–15 +2
16–17 +3
18–19 +4
20 +5
Step 4: Alignment
Choose your character’s alignment from the options
below, and note it on your character sheet.
The game assumes that player characters aren’t of
an evil alignment. Check with your GM before mak-
ing an evil character.
The Nine Alignments
A creature’s alignment broadly describes its ethical
attitudes and ideals. Alignment is a combination of
two factors: one identifies morality (good, evil, or
neutral), and the other describes attitudes toward
order (lawful, chaotic, or neutral).
The summaries of the alignments below describe
the typical behavior of a creature with that align-
ment; individuals can vary from that behavior.
Lawful Good (LG). Lawful Good creatures en-
deavor to do the right thing as expected by society.
Someone who fights injustice and protects the inno-
cent without hesitation is probably Lawful Good.
Neutral Good (NG). Neutral Good creatures do the
best they can, working within rules but not feeling
bound by them. A kindly person who helps others
according to their needs is probably Neutral Good.
Chaotic Good (CG). Chaotic Good creatures act as
their conscience directs with little regard for what
others expect. A rebel who waylays a cruel baron’s
tax collectors and uses the stolen money to help the
poor is probably Chaotic Good.
Lawful Neutral (LN). Lawful Neutral individuals
act in accordance with law, tradition, or personal
codes. Someone who follows a disciplined rule of
life—and isn’t swayed either by the demands of
those in need or by the temptations of evil—is prob-
ably Lawful Neutral.
Neutral (N). Neutral is the alignment of those who
prefer to avoid moral questions and don’t take sides,

unaliGnEd crEaturEs
Most creatures that lack the capacity for rational
thought don’t have alignments; they are unaligned.
Sharks are savage predators, for example, but they
aren’t evil; they are unaligned.
doing what seems best at the time. Someone who’s
bored by moral debate is probably Neutral.
Chaotic Neutral (CN). Chaotic Neutral creatures
follow their whims, valuing their personal freedom
above all else. A scoundrel who wanders the land
living by their wits is probably Chaotic Neutral.
Lawful Evil (LE). Lawful Evil creatures methodi-
cally take what they want within the limits of a code
of tradition, loyalty, or order. An aristocrat exploit-
ing citizens while scheming for power is probably
Lawful Evil.
Neutral Evil (NE). Neutral Evil is the alignment of
those who are untroubled by the harm they cause as
they pursue their desires. A criminal who robs and
murders as they please is probably Neutral Evil.
Chaotic Evil (CE). Chaotic Evil creatures act
with arbitrary violence, spurred by their hatred or
bloodlust. A villain pursuing schemes of vengeance
and havoc is probably Chaotic Evil.
Step 5: Character Creation Details
Now fill in the rest of your character sheet.
Record Class Features
Look at your class’s feature table in “Classes,” and
write down the level 1 features. The class features
are detailed there too.
Some class features offer choices. Make sure to
read all your features and make any offered choices.
Fill In Numbers
Note these numbers on your character sheet.
Saving Throws. For the saving throws you have
proficiency in, add your Proficiency Bonus to the ap-
propriate ability modifier and note the total. Some
players also like to note the modifier for saving
throws they’re not proficient in, which is just the
relevant ability modifier.
Skills. For skills you have proficiency in, add your
Proficiency Bonus to the ability modifier associated
with that skill, and note the total. You might also
wish to note the modifier for skills you’re not profi-
cient in, which is just the relevant ability modifier.
Passive Perception. Sometimes your GM will de-
termine whether your character notices something
without asking you to make a Wisdom (Perception)
check; the GM uses your Passive Perception instead.
Passive Perception is a score that reflects a general
awareness of your surroundings when you’re not
actively looking for something. Use this formula to
determine your Passive Perception score:
Passive Perception = 10 + Wisdom (Perception)
check modifier
Include all modifiers that apply to your Wisdom
(Perception) checks. For example, if your character
has a Wisdom of 15 and proficiency in the Percep-
tion skill, you have a Passive Perception of 14 (10 +
2 for your Wisdom modifier + 2 for proficiency).
Hit Points. Your class and Constitution modifier
determine your Hit Point maximum at level 1, as
shown on the Level 1 Hit Points by Class table.
Level 1 Hit Points by Class
Class Hit Point Maximum
Barbarian 12 + Con. modifier
Fighter, Paladin, or Ranger 10 + Con. modifier
Bard, Cleric, Druid, Monk,
Rogue, or Warlock
8 + Con. modifier
Sorcerer or Wizard 6 + Con. modifier
The character sheet includes room to note your
current Hit Points when you take damage, as well as
any Temporary Hit Points you might gain. There’s
also space to track Death Saving Throws.
Hit Point Dice. Your class’s description tells you
the die type of your character’s Hit Point Dice (or
Hit Dice for short); write this on your character
sheet. At level 1, your character has 1 Hit Die. You
can spend Hit Dice during a Short Rest to recover
Hit Points. Your character sheet also includes space
to note how many Hit Dice you’ve spent.
Initiative. Write your Dexterity modifier in the
space for Initiative on your character sheet.
Armor Class. Without armor or a shield, your
base Armor Class is 10 plus your Dexterity modi-
fier. If your starting equipment includes armor or a
Shield (or both), calculate your AC using the rules in
“Equipment.” A class feature might give you a differ-
ent way to calculate your AC.
Attacks. In the Weapons & Damage Cantrips
section of the character sheet, write your starting
weapons. The attack roll bonus for a weapon with
which you have proficiency is one of the following
unless a weapon’s property says otherwise:
Melee attack bonus = Strength modifier
+ Proficiency Bonus
Ranged attack bonus = Dexterity modifier
+ Proficiency Bonus
Look up the damage and properties of your
weapons in “Equipment.” You add the same ability
modifier you use for attacks with a weapon to your
damage rolls with that weapon.
Spellcasting. Note both the saving throw DC for
your spells and the attack bonus for attacks you
make with them, using these formulas:

Spell save DC = 8 + spellcasting ability modifier
+ Proficiency Bonus
Spell attack bonus = spellcasting ability modifier
+ Proficiency Bonus
Your spellcasting ability modifier for a spell is de-
termined by whatever feature gives you the ability
to cast the spell.
Spell Slots, Cantrips, and Prepared Spells. If
your class gives you the Spellcasting or Pact Magic
feature, your class features table shows the number
of spell slots you have available, how many cantrips
you know, and how many spells you can prepare.
Choose your cantrips and prepared spells, and note
them—along with your number of spell slots—on
your character sheet.
Level Advancement
While going on adventures, your character gains ex-
perience, represented by Experience Points (XP). A
character who reaches a specified Experience Point
total advances in capability. This advancement is
called gaining a level.
The Character Advancement table lists the XP
you need to advance to a level and the Proficiency
Bonus for a character of that level. When your XP
total equals or exceeds a number in the Experience
Points column, you reach the corresponding level.
Character Advancement
Level Experience Points Proficiency Bonus
1 0 +2
2 300 +2
3 900 +2
4 2,700 +2
5 6,500 +3
6 14,000 +3
7 23,000 +3
8 34,000 +3
9 48,000 +4
10 64,000 +4
11 85,000 +4
12 100,000 +4
13 120,000 +5
14 140,000 +5
15 165,000 +5
16 195,000 +5
17 225,000 +6
18 265,000 +6
19 305,000 +6
20 355,000 +6
Gaining a Level
When you gain a level, follow these steps:
1: Choose a Class. Most characters advance in the
same class. However, you might decide to gain a
level in another class using the rules in the “Mul-
ticlassing” section.
2: Adjust Hit Points and Hit Point Dice. Each time
you gain a level, you gain an additional Hit Die.
Roll that die, add your Constitution modifier to
the roll, and add the total (minimum of 1) to your
Hit Point maximum. Instead of rolling, you can
use the fixed value shown in the Fixed Hit Points
by Class table.
Fixed Hit Points by Class
Class Hit Points per Level
Barbarian 7 + Con. modifier
Fighter, Paladin, or Ranger 6 + Con. modifier
Bard, Cleric, Druid, Monk,
Rogue, or Warlock
5 + Con. modifier
Sorcerer or Wizard 4 + Con. modifier
3: Record New Class Features. Look at your class
features table in “Classes,” and note the features
you gain at your new level in that class. Make any
choices offered by a new feature.
4: Adjust Proficiency Bonus. A character’s Pro-
ficiency Bonus increases at certain levels, as
shown in the Character Advancement table and
your class features table in “Classes.” When your
Proficiency Bonus increases, increase all the
numbers on your character sheet that include
your Proficiency Bonus.
5: Adjust Ability Modifiers. If you choose a feat
that increases one or more of your ability scores,
your ability modifier also changes if the new
score is an even number. When that happens, ad-
just all the numbers on your character sheet that
use that ability modifier. When your Constitution
modifier increases by 1, your Hit Point maximum
increases by 1 for each level you have attained.
For example, if a character reaches level 8 and
increases their Constitution score from 17 to 18,
the Constitution modifier increases to +4. The
character’s Hit Point maximum then increases by
8, in addition to the Hit Points gained for reach-
ing level 8.
Tiers of Play
With each new level, characters acquire new ca-
pabilities that equip them to handle greater chal-
lenges. As characters advance in level, the tone of
the game also changes, and the stakes of the cam-
paign get higher. It’s helpful to think of a character’s
(and a campaign’s) arc in terms of four tiers of play,

B onus FEats at lEvEl 20
A GM can use feats as a form of advancement after
characters reach level 20 to provide greater power
to characters who have no more levels to gain. With
this approach, each character gains one feat of their
choice for every 30,000 XP the character earns
above 355,000 XP. Epic Boon feats are especially
appropriate for these bonus feats, but a player can
choose any feat for which their level 20 character
qualifies.
describing the journey from a level 1 character just
beginning an adventuring career to the epic heights
of level 20. These tiers don’t have any rules associ-
ated with them; they point to the fact that the play
experience evolves as characters gain levels.
Tier 1 (Levels 1–4)
In tier 1, characters are apprentice adventurers,
though they are already set apart from the broader
populace by virtue of their extraordinary abilities.
They learn their starting class features and choose
a subclass. The threats they face usually pose a dan-
ger to local farmsteads or villages.
Tier 2 (Levels 5–10)
In tier 2, characters are full-fledged adventurers.
Spellcasters gain iconic spells such as Fireball, Light-
ning Bolt, and Raise Dead. Most weapon-focused
classes gain the ability to make multiple attacks
in a round. The characters now face dangers that
threaten cities and kingdoms.
Tier 3 (Levels 11–16)
In tier 3, characters have reached a level of power
that makes them special among adventurers. At
level 11, many spellcasters learn reality-altering
spells. Other characters gain features that allow
them to make more attacks or to do more impres-
sive things with those attacks. These adventurers
often confront threats to whole regions.
Tier 4 (Levels 17–20)
At tier 4, characters achieve the pinnacle of their
class features, becoming heroic archetypes. The
fate of the world or even the order of the multiverse
might hang in the balance during their adventures.
Starting at Higher Levels
Your GM might start your group’s characters at a
level higher than 1. It is particularly recommended
to start at level 3 if your group is composed of sea-
soned D&D players.
Creating Your Character
Creating a higher-level character uses the same
character-creation steps outlined in this chapter
and the rules for advancing beyond level 1 provided
in the “Level Advancement” section. You begin with
the minimum amount of XP required to reach your
starting level. For example, if the GM starts you at
level 10, you have 64,000 XP.
Starting Equipment
The GM decides whether your character starts with
more than the standard equipment for a level 1
character, possibly even one or more magic items.
The Starting Equipment at Higher Levels table is a
guide for the GM.
Also, check with your GM about what equipment
is available for you to buy with your starting money.
For example, the firearms described in “Equipment”
are too expensive for level 1 characters, but they
might be available for purchase if your GM allows
them.
Multiclassing
Multiclassing allows you to gain levels in multiple
classes. With this rule, you have the option of gain-
ing a level in a new class whenever you advance in
level instead of gaining a level in your current class.
Doing so lets you mix the abilities of those classes
to realize a character concept that might not be re-
flected in a single class.
Prerequisites
To qualify for a new class, you must have a score of
at least 13 in the primary ability of the new class
and your current classes. For example, a Barbarian
who decides to multiclass into the Druid class must
have Strength and Wisdom scores of 13 or higher,
Starting Equipment at Higher Levels
Starting Level Equipment and Money Magic Items
2–4 Normal starting equipment 1 Common
5–10 500 GP plus 1d10 × 25 GP plus
normal starting equipment
1 Common, 1 Uncommon
11–16 5,000 gp plus 1d10 × 250 GP plus
normal starting equipment
2 Common, 3 Uncommon, 1 Rare
17–20 20,000 GP plus 1d10 × 250 GP plus
normal starting equipment
2 Common, 4 Uncommon, 3 Rare, 1 Very Rare

since Strength is the primary ability for Barbarians
and Wisdom is the primary ability for Druids.
Experience Points
The Experience Point cost to gain a level is based on
your total character level, not your level in a partic-
ular class, as shown in the Character Advancement
table in “Character Creation.” For example, if you
are a level 6 Cleric / level 1 Fighter, you must gain
enough XP to reach level 8 before you can take your
second level as a Fighter or your seventh level as a
Cleric.
Hit Points and Hit Point Dice
You gain the Hit Points from your new class as de-
scribed for levels after 1. You gain the level 1 Hit
Points for a class only when your total character
level is 1.
Add together the Hit Dice granted by all your
classes to form your pool of Hit Dice. If these dice
are the same die type, you can pool them together.
For example, both the Fighter and the Paladin have
a d10 Hit Die, so if you are a level 5 Fighter / level 5
Paladin, you have ten d10 Hit Dice. If your classes
give you Hit Dice of different types, track them sep-
arately. If you are a level 5 Cleric / level 5 Paladin,
for example, you have five d8 Hit Dice and five d10
Hit Dice.
Proficiency Bonus
Your Proficiency Bonus is based on your total char-
acter level, not your level in a particular class, as
shown in the Character Advancement table. For
example, if you are a level 3 Fighter / level 2 Rogue,
you have the Proficiency Bonus of a level 5 charac-
ter, which is +3.
Proficiencies
When you gain your first level in a class other than
your initial class, you gain only some of the new
class’s starting proficiencies, as detailed in each
class’s description in “Classes.”
Class Features
When you gain a new level in a class, you get its fea-
tures for that level. A few features have additional
rules when you’re multiclassing. Check the infor-
mation about multiclassing included in each of your
classes’ descriptions.
Special rules apply to Extra Attack, Spellcasting,
and features (such as Unarmored Defense) that give
you alternative ways to calculate your Armor Class.
Armor Class
If you have multiple ways to calculate your Armor
Class, you can benefit from only one at a time.
For example, a Monk/Sorcerer with a Monk’s
Unarmored Defense feature and a Sorcerer’s Dra-
conic Resilience feature must choose only one of
those features as a way to calculate Armor Class.
Extra Attack
If you gain the Extra Attack feature from more than
one class, the features don’t stack. You can’t make
more than two attacks with this feature unless you
have a feature that says you can (such as the Fight-
er’s Two Extra Attacks feature).
Similarly, the Warlock’s Thirsting Blade invo-
cation, which grants you the Extra Attack feature
with your pact weapon, doesn’t give you additional
attacks if you also have Extra Attack.
Spellcasting
Your capacity for spellcasting depends partly on
your combined levels in all your spellcasting classes
and partly on your individual levels in those classes.
Once you have the Spellcasting feature from more
than one class, use the rules below. If you multiclass
but have the Spellcasting feature from only one
class, follow the rules for that class.
Spells Prepared. You determine what spells you
can prepare for each class individually, as if you
were a single-classed member of that class. If you
are a level 4 Ranger / level 3 Sorcerer, for example,
you can prepare five level 1 Ranger spells, and you
can prepare six Sorcerer spells of level 1 or 2 (as
well as four Sorcerer cantrips).
Each spell you prepare is associated with one of
your classes, and you use the spellcasting ability of
that class when you cast the spell.
Cantrips. If a cantrip of yours increases in power
at higher levels, the increase is based on your total
character level, not your level in a particular class,
unless the spell says otherwise.
Spell Slots. You determine your available spell
slots by adding together the following:
• All your levels in the Bard, Cleric, Druid, Sorcerer,
and Wizard classes
• Half your levels (round up) in the Paladin and
Ranger classes
Then look up this total level in the Level column of
the Multiclass Spellcaster table. You use the slots for
that level to cast spells of an appropriate level from
any class whose Spellcasting feature you have.
This table might give you spell slots of a higher
level than the spells you prepare. You can use those
slots but only to cast your lower-level spells. If a
lower-level spell that you cast, like Burning Hands,
has an enhanced effect when cast at a higher level,
you can use the enhanced effect as normal.
For example, if you are a level 4 Ranger / level 3
Sorcerer, you count as a level 5 character when de-
termining your spell slots, counting all your levels
as a Sorcerer and half your Ranger levels. As shown

in the Multiclass Spellcaster table, you have four
level 1 spell slots, three level 2 slots, and two level 3
slots. However, you can’t prepare any level 3 spells,
nor can you prepare any level 2 Ranger spells. You
can use the spell slots of those levels to cast the
spells you do prepare—and potentially enhance
their effects.
Pact Magic. If you have the Pact Magic feature
from the Warlock class and the Spellcasting feature,
you can use the spell slots you gain from Pact Magic
to cast spells you have prepared from classes with
the Spellcasting feature, and you can use the spell
slots you gain from the Spellcasting feature to cast
Warlock spells you have prepared.

Trinkets
When you make your character, you can roll once
on the Trinkets table to gain a Tiny trinket, a simple
item lightly touched by mystery. The GM might also
use this table. It can help stock a room in a dungeon
or fill a creature’s pockets.

Rage, a force that grants you extraordinary might
and resilience. You can enter it as a Bonus Action if
you aren’t wearing Heavy armor.
You can enter your Rage the number of times
shown for your Barbarian level in the Rages column
of the Barbarian Features table. You regain one ex-
pended use when you finish a Short Rest, and you
regain all expended uses when you finish a Long
Rest.

While active, your Rage follows the rules below.
Damage Resistance. You have Resistance to Blud-
geoning, Piercing, and Slashing damage.
Rage Damage. When you make an attack using
Strength—with either a weapon or an Unarmed
Strike—and deal damage to the target, you gain
a bonus to the damage that increases as you gain
levels as a Barbarian, as shown in the Rage Damage
column of the Barbarian Features table.
Strength Advantage. You have Advantage on
Strength checks and Strength saving throws.
No Concentration or Spells. You can’t maintain
Concentration, and you can’t cast spells.
Duration. The Rage lasts until the end of your
next turn, and it ends early if you don Heavy armor
or have the Incapacitated condition. If your Rage
is still active on your next turn, you can extend
the Rage for another round by doing one of the
following:
• Make an attack roll against an enemy.
• Force an enemy to make a saving throw.
• Take a Bonus Action to extend your Rage.
Each time the Rage is extended, it lasts until the end
of your next turn. You can maintain a Rage for up to
10 minutes.
Level 1: Unarmored Defense
While you aren’t wearing any armor, your base Ar-
mor Class equals 10 plus your Dexterity and Consti-
tution modifiers. You can use a Shield and still gain
this benefit.
Level 1: Weapon Mastery
Your training with weapons allows you to use the
mastery properties of two kinds of Simple or Mar-
tial Melee weapons of your choice, such as Great-
axes and Handaxes. Whenever you finish a Long
Rest, you can practice weapon drills and change one
of those weapon choices.
When you reach certain Barbarian levels, you gain
the ability to use the mastery properties of more
kinds of weapons, as shown in the Weapon Mastery
column of the Barbarian Features table.
Level 2: Danger Sense
You gain an uncanny sense of when things aren’t as
they should be, giving you an edge when you dodge
perils. You have Advantage on Dexterity saving
throws unless you have the Incapacitated condition.
Level 2: Reckless Attack
You can throw aside all concern for defense to at-
tack with increased ferocity. When you make your
first attack roll on your turn, you can decide to at-
tack recklessly. Doing so gives you Advantage on at-
tack rolls using Strength until the start of your next
turn, but attack rolls against you have Advantage
during that time.
Level 3: Barbarian Subclass
You gain a Barbarian subclass of your choice. The
Path of the Berserker subclass is detailed after this
class’s description. A subclass is a specialization
that grants you features at certain Barbarian levels.
For the rest of your career, you gain each of your
subclass’s features that are of your Barbarian level
or lower.
Level 3: Primal Knowledge
You gain proficiency in another skill of your choice
from the skill list available to Barbarians at level 1.
In addition, while your Rage is active, you can
channel primal power when you attempt certain
tasks; whenever you make an ability check using
one of the following skills, you can make it as a
Strength check even if it normally uses a differ-
ent ability: Acrobatics, Intimidation, Perception,
Stealth, or Survival. When you use this ability, your
Strength represents primal power coursing through
you, honing your agility, bearing, and senses.
Level 4: Ability Score Improvement
You gain the Ability Score Improvement feat (see
“Feats”) or another feat of your choice for which you
qualify. You gain this feature again at Barbarian lev-
els 8, 12, and 16.
Level 5: Extra Attack
You can attack twice instead of once whenever you
take the Attack action on your turn.
Level 5: Fast Movement
Your speed increases by 10 feet while you aren’t
wearing Heavy armor.
Level 7: Feral Instinct
Your instincts are so honed that you have Advan-
tage on Initiative rolls.
Level 7: Instinctive Pounce
As part of the Bonus Action you take to enter your
Rage, you can move up to half your Speed.
Level 9: Brutal Strike
If you use Reckless Attack, you can forgo any Ad-
vantage on one Strength-based attack roll of your
choice on your turn. The chosen attack roll mustn’t
have Disadvantage. If the chosen attack roll hits, the
target takes an extra 1d10 damage of the same type
dealt by the weapon or Unarmed Strike, and you can
cause one Brutal Strike effect of your choice. You
have the following effect options.
Forceful Blow. The target is pushed 15 feet
straight away from you. You can then move up to
half your Speed straight toward the target without
provoking Opportunity Attacks.

Hamstring Blow. The target’s Speed is reduced by
15 feet until the start of your next turn. A target can
be affected by only one Hamstring Blow at a time—
the most recent one.
Level 11: Relentless Rage
Your Rage can keep you fighting despite grievous
wounds. If you drop to 0 Hit Points while your Rage
is active and don’t die outright, you can make a DC
10 Constitution saving throw. If you succeed, your
Hit Points instead change to a number equal to
twice your Barbarian level.
Each time you use this feature after the first, the
DC increases by 5. When you finish a Short or Long
Rest, the DC resets to 10.
Level 13: Improved Brutal Strike
You have honed new ways to attack furiously. The
following effects are now among your Brutal Strike
options.
Staggering Blow. The target has Disadvantage on
the next saving throw it makes, and it can’t make
Opportunity Attacks until the start of your next
turn.
Sundering Blow. Before the start of your next
turn, the next attack roll made by another creature
against the target gains a +5 bonus to the roll. An
attack roll can gain only one Sundering Blow bonus.
Level 15: Persistent Rage
When you roll Initiative, you can regain all ex-
pended uses of Rage. After you regain uses of Rage
in this way, you can’t do so again until you finish a
Long Rest.
In addition, your Rage is so fierce that it now lasts
for 10 minutes without you needing to do anything
to extend it from round to round. Your Rage ends
early if you have the Unconscious condition (not just
the Incapacitated condition) or don Heavy armor.
Level 17: Improved Brutal Strike
The extra damage of your Brutal Strike increases to
2d10. In addition, you can use two different Brutal
Strike effects whenever you use your Brutal Strike
feature.
Level 18: Indomitable Might
If your total for a Strength check or Strength saving
throw is less than your Strength score, you can use
that score in place of the total.
Level 19: Epic Boon
You gain an Epic Boon feat (see “Feats”) or another
feat of your choice for which you qualify. Boon of
Irresistible Offense is recommended.
Level 20: Primal Champion
You embody primal power. Your Strength and Con-
stitution scores increase by 4, to a maximum of 25.
Barbarian Subclass:
Path of the Berserker
Channel Rage into Violent Fury
Barbarians who walk the Path of the Berserker
direct their Rage primarily toward violence. Their
path is one of untrammeled fury, and they thrill in
the chaos of battle as they allow their Rage to seize
and empower them.
Level 3: Frenzy
If you use Reckless Attack while your Rage is active,
you deal extra damage to the first target you hit on
your turn with a Strength-based attack. To deter-
mine the extra damage, roll a number of d6s equal
to your Rage Damage bonus, and add them together.
The damage has the same type as the weapon or
Unarmed Strike used for the attack.
Level 6: Mindless Rage
You have Immunity to the Charmed and Fright-
ened conditions while your Rage is active. If you’re
Charmed or Frightened when you enter your Rage,
the condition ends on you.
Level 10: Retaliation
When you take damage from a creature that is
within 5 feet of you, you can take a Reaction to
make one melee attack against that creature, using
a weapon or an Unarmed Strike.
Level 14: Intimidating Presence
As a Bonus Action, you can strike terror into others
with your menacing presence and primal power.
When you do so, each creature of your choice in a
30-foot Emanation originating from you must make
a Wisdom saving throw (DC 8 plus your Strength
modifier and Proficiency Bonus). On a failed save,
a creature has the Frightened condition for 1 min-
ute. At the end of each of the Frightened creature’s
turns, the creature repeats the save, ending the ef-
fect on itself on a success.
Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again
until you finish a Long Rest unless you expend a use
of your Rage (no action required) to restore your
use of it.

one of your Bardic Inspiration dice. A creature can
have only one Bardic Inspiration die at a time.
Once within the next hour when the creature fails
a D20 Test, the creature can roll the Bardic Inspira-
tion die and add the number rolled to the d20, po-
tentially turning the failure into a success. A Bardic
Inspiration die is expended when it’s rolled.
Number of Uses. You can confer a Bardic Inspira-
tion die a number of times equal to your Charisma
modifier (minimum of once), and you regain all ex-
pended uses when you finish a Long Rest.
At Higher Levels. Your Bardic Inspiration die
changes when you reach certain Bard levels, as
shown in the Bardic Die column of the Bard Fea-
tures table. The die becomes a d8 at level 5, a d10 at
level 10, and a d12 at level 15.
Level 1: Spellcasting
You have learned to cast spells through your bardic
arts. See “Spells” for the rules on spellcasting. The
information below details how you use those rules
with Bard spells, which appear in the Bard spell list
later in the class’s description.
Cantrips. You know two cantrips of your choice
from the Bard spell list. Dancing Lights and Vicious
Mockery are recommended.
Whenever you gain a Bard level, you can replace
one of your cantrips with another cantrip of your
choice from the Bard spell list.
When you reach Bard levels 4 and 10, you learn
another cantrip of your choice from the Bard spell
list, as shown in the Cantrips column of the Bard
Features table.
Spell Slots. The Bard Features table shows how
many spell slots you have to cast your level 1+
spells. You regain all expended slots when you fin-
ish a Long Rest.
Prepared Spells of Level 1+. You prepare the
list of level 1+ spells that are available for you to
cast with this feature. To start, choose four level 1
spells from the Bard spell list. Charm Person, Color
Spray, Dissonant Whispers, and Healing Word are
recommended.
The number of spells on your list increases as you
gain Bard levels, as shown in the Prepared Spells
column of the Bard Features table. Whenever that
number increases, choose additional spells from the
Bard spell list until the number of spells on your list
matches the number on the table. The chosen spells
must be of a level for which you have spell slots.
For example, if you’re a level 3 Bard, your list of
prepared spells can include six spells of levels 1 and
2 in any combination.
If another Bard feature gives you spells that you
always have prepared, those spells don’t count
against the number of spells you can prepare with
this feature, but those spells otherwise count as
Bard spells for you.
Changing Your Prepared Spells. Whenever you
gain a Bard level, you can replace one spell on your
list with another Bard spell for which you have spell
slots.
Spellcasting Ability. Charisma is your spellcast-
ing ability for your Bard spells.
Spellcasting Focus. You can use a Musical Instru-
ment as a Spellcasting Focus for your Bard spells.
Level 2: Expertise
You gain Expertise (see “Rules Glossary”) in two of
your skill proficiencies of your choice. Performance
and Persuasion are recommended if you have profi-
ciency in them.
At Bard level 9, you gain Expertise in two more of
your skill proficiencies of your choice.
Level 2: Jack of All Trades
You can add half your Proficiency Bonus (round
down) to any ability check you make that uses a
skill proficiency you lack and that doesn’t otherwise
use your Proficiency Bonus.
For example, if you make a Strength (Athletics)
check and lack Athletics proficiency, you can add
half your Proficiency Bonus to the check.
Level 3: Bard Subclass
You gain a Bard subclass of your choice. The College
of Lore subclass is detailed after this class’s descrip-
tion. A subclass is a specialization that grants you
features at certain Bard levels. For the rest of your
career, you gain each of your subclass’s features
that are of your Bard level or lower.
Level 4: Ability Score Improvement
You gain the Ability Score Improvement feat (see
“Feats”) or another feat of your choice for which you
qualify. You gain this feature again at Bard levels 8,
12, and 16.
Level 5: Font of Inspiration
You now regain all your expended uses of Bardic In-
spiration when you finish a Short or Long Rest.
In addition, you can expend a spell slot (no action
required) to regain one expended use of Bardic
Inspiration.

Level 7: Countercharm
You can use musical notes or words of power to dis-
rupt mind-influencing effects. If you or a creature
within 30 feet of you fails a saving throw against an
effect that applies the Charmed or Frightened con-
dition, you can take a Reaction to cause the save to
be rerolled, and the new roll has Advantage.
Level 10: Magical Secrets
You’ve learned secrets from various magical tradi-
tions. Whenever you reach a Bard level (including
this level) and the Prepared Spells number in the
Bard Features table increases, you can choose any
of your new prepared spells from the Bard, Cleric,
Druid, and Wizard spell lists, and the chosen spells
count as Bard spells for you (see a class’s section for
its spell list). In addition, whenever you replace a
spell prepared for this class, you can replace it with
a spell from those lists.
Level 18: Superior Inspiration
When you roll Initiative, you regain expended uses
of Bardic Inspiration until you have two if you have
fewer than that.
Level 19: Epic Boon
You gain an Epic Boon feat (see “Feats”) or another
feat of your choice for which you qualify. Boon of
Spell Recall is recommended.
Level 20: Words of Creation
You have mastered two of the Words of Creation:
the words of life and death. You therefore always
have the Power Word Heal and Power Word Kill
spells prepared. When you cast either spell, you can
target a second creature with it if that creature is
within 10 feet of the first target.
Bard Spell List
This section presents the Bard spell list. The spells
are organized by spell level and then alphabetized,
and each spell’s school of magic is listed. In the Spe-
cial column, C means the spell requires Concentra-
tion, R means it’s a Ritual, and M means it requires a
specific Material component.

Bard Subclass:
College of Lore
Plumb the Depths of Magical Knowledge
Bards of the College of Lore collect spells and se-
crets from diverse sources, such as scholarly tomes,
mystical rites, and peasant tales. The college’s mem-
bers gather in libraries and universities to share
their lore with one another. They also meet at festi-
vals or affairs of state, where they can expose cor-
ruption, unravel lies, and poke fun at self-important
figures of authority.
Level 3: Bonus Proficiencies
You gain proficiency with three skills of your choice.
Level 3: Cutting Words
You learn to use your wit to supernaturally distract,
confuse, and otherwise sap the confidence and com-
petence of others. When a creature that you can see
within 60 feet of yourself makes a damage roll or
succeeds on an ability check or attack roll, you can
take a Reaction to expend one use of your Bardic
Inspiration; roll your Bardic Inspiration die, and
subtract the number rolled from the creature’s roll,
reducing the damage or potentially turning the suc-
cess into a failure.
Level 6: Magical Discoveries
You learn two spells of your choice. These spells can
come from the Cleric, Druid, or Wizard spell list or
any combination thereof (see a class’s section for its
spell list). A spell you choose must be a cantrip or a
spell for which you have spell slots, as shown in the
Bard Features table.
You always have the chosen spells prepared, and
whenever you gain a Bard level, you can replace one
of the spells with another spell that meets these
requirements.
Level 14: Peerless Skill
When you make an ability check or attack roll and
fail, you can expend one use of Bardic Inspiration;
roll the Bardic Inspiration die, and add the number
rolled to the d20, potentially turning a failure into
a success. On a failure, the Bardic Inspiration isn’t
expended.

When you reach Cleric levels 4 and 10, you learn
another cantrip of your choice from the Cleric spell
list, as shown in the Cantrips column of the Cleric
Features table.
Spell Slots. The Cleric Features table shows how
many spell slots you have to cast your level 1+
spells. You regain all expended slots when you fin-
ish a Long Rest.
Prepared Spells of Level 1+. You prepare the list
of level 1+ spells that are available for you to cast
with this feature. To start, choose four level 1 spells
from the Cleric spell list. Bless, Cure Wounds, Guiding
Bolt, and Shield of Faith are recommended.
The number of spells on your list increases as you
gain Cleric levels, as shown in the Prepared Spells
column of the Cleric Features table. Whenever that
number increases, choose additional spells from the
Cleric spell list until the number of spells on your
list matches the number on the table. The chosen
spells must be of a level for which you have spell
slots. For example, if you’re a level 3 Cleric, your list
of prepared spells can include six spells of levels 1
and 2 in any combination.
If another Cleric feature gives you spells that
you always have prepared, those spells don’t count
against the number of spells you can prepare with
this feature, but those spells otherwise count as
Cleric spells for you.
Changing Your Prepared Spells. Whenever you
finish a Long Rest, you can change your list of pre-
pared spells, replacing any of the spells there with
other Cleric spells for which you have spell slots.
Spellcasting Ability. Wisdom is your spellcasting
ability for your Cleric spells.
Spellcasting Focus. You can use a Holy Symbol as
a Spellcasting Focus for your Cleric spells.
Level 1: Divine Order
You have dedicated yourself to one of the following
sacred roles of your choice.
Protector. Trained for battle, you gain proficiency
with Martial weapons and training with Heavy
armor.
Thaumaturge. You know one extra cantrip from
the Cleric spell list. In addition, your mystical con-
nection to the divine gives you a bonus to your
Intelligence (Arcana or Religion) checks. The bonus
equals your Wisdom modifier (minimum of +1).
Level 2: Channel Divinity
You can channel divine energy directly from the
Outer Planes to fuel magical effects. You start with
two such effects: Divine Spark and Turn Undead,
each of which is described below. Each time you use
this class’s Channel Divinity, choose which Channel
Divinity effect from this class to create. You gain ad-
ditional effect options at higher Cleric levels.
You can use this class’s Channel Divinity twice.
You regain one of its expended uses when you finish
a Short Rest, and you regain all expended uses when
you finish a Long Rest. You gain additional uses
when you reach certain Cleric levels, as shown in
the Channel Divinity column of the Cleric Features
table.
If a Channel Divinity effect requires a saving
throw, the DC equals the spell save DC from this
class’s Spellcasting feature.
Divine Spark. As a Magic action, you point your
Holy Symbol at another creature you can see within
30 feet of yourself and focus divine energy at it.
Roll 1d8 and add your Wisdom modifier. You either
restore Hit Points to the creature equal to that total
or force the creature to make a Constitution saving
throw. On a failed save, the creature takes Necrotic
or Radiant damage (your choice) equal to that to-
tal. On a successful save, the creature takes half as
much damage (round down).
You roll an additional d8 when you reach Cleric
levels 7 (2d8), 13 (3d8), and 18 (4d8).
Turn Undead. As a Magic action, you present your
Holy Symbol and censure Undead creatures. Each
Undead of your choice within 30 feet of you must
make a Wisdom saving throw. If the creature fails
its save, it has the Frightened and Incapacitated
conditions for 1 minute. For that duration, it tries
to move as far from you as it can on its turns. This
effect ends early on the creature if it takes any dam-
age, if you have the Incapacitated condition, or if
you die.
Level 3: Cleric Subclass
You gain a Cleric subclass of your choice. The Life
Domain subclass is detailed after this class’s de-
scription. A subclass is a specialization that grants
you features at certain Cleric levels. For the rest of
your career, you gain each of your subclass’s fea-
tures that are of your Cleric level or lower.
Level 4: Ability Score Improvement
You gain the Ability Score Improvement feat (see
“Feats”) or another feat of your choice for which you
qualify. You gain this feature again at Cleric levels 8,
12, and 16.
Level 5: Sear Undead
Whenever you use Turn Undead, you can roll a
number of d8s equal to your Wisdom modifier
(minimum of 1d8) and add the rolls together. Each
Undead that fails its saving throw against that use
of Turn Undead takes Radiant damage equal to the
roll’s total. This damage doesn’t end the turn effect.

Level 7: Blessed Strikes
Divine power infuses you in battle. You gain one of
the following options of your choice (if you get ei-
ther option from a Cleric subclass in an older book,
use only the option you choose for this feature).
Divine Strike. Once on each of your turns when
you hit a creature with an attack roll using a
weapon, you can cause the target to take an extra
1d8 Necrotic or Radiant damage (your choice).
Potent Spellcasting. Add your Wisdom modifier
to the damage you deal with any Cleric cantrip.
Level 10: Divine Intervention
You can call on your deity or pantheon to inter-
vene on your behalf. As a Magic action, choose any
Cleric spell of level 5 or lower that doesn’t require a
Reaction to cast. As part of the same action, you cast
that spell without expending a spell slot or needing
Material components. You can’t use this feature
again until you finish a Long Rest.
Level 14: Improved Blessed Strikes
The option you chose for Blessed Strikes grows
more powerful.
Divine Strike. The extra damage of your Divine
Strike increases to 2d8.
Potent Spellcasting. When you cast a Cleric can-
trip and deal damage to a creature with it, you can
give vitality to yourself or another creature within
60 feet of yourself, granting a number of Temporary
Hit Points equal to twice your Wisdom modifier.
Level 19: Epic Boon
You gain an Epic Boon feat (see “Feats”) or another
feat of your choice for which you qualify. Boon of
Fate is recommended.
Level 20: Greater Divine Intervention
You can call on even more powerful divine interven-
tion. When you use your Divine Intervention fea-
ture, you can choose Wish when you select a spell.
If you do so, you can’t use Divine Intervention again
until you finish 2d4 Long Rests.
Cleric Spell List
This section presents the Cleric spell list. The spells
are organized by spell level and then alphabetized,
and each spell’s school of magic is listed. In the Spe-
cial column, C means the spell requires Concentra-
tion, R means it’s a Ritual, and M means it requires a
specific Material component.

Cleric Subclass: Life Domain
Soothe the Hurts of the World
The Life Domain focuses on the positive energy that
helps sustain all life in the multiverse. Clerics who
tap into this domain are masters of healing, using
that life force to cure many hurts.
Existence itself relies on the positive energy as-
sociated with this domain, so a Cleric of almost any
religious tradition might choose it. This domain is
particularly associated with agricultural deities,
gods of healing or endurance, and gods of home and
community. Religious orders of healing also seek
the magic of this domain.
Level 3: Disciple of Life
When a spell you cast with a spell slot restores Hit
Points to a creature, that creature regains addi-
tional Hit Points on the turn you cast the spell. The
additional Hit Points equal 2 plus the spell slot’s
level.
Level 3: Life Domain Spells
Your connection to this divine domain ensures you
always have certain spells ready. When you reach
a Cleric level specified in the Life Domain Spells
table, you thereafter always have the listed spells
prepared.
Life Domain Spells

3 Aid, Bless, Cure Wounds,

7 Aura of Life, Death Ward
9 Greater Restoration, Mass Cure Wounds
Level 3: Preserve Life
As a Magic action, you present your Holy Symbol
and expend a use of your Channel Divinity to evoke
healing energy that can restore a number of Hit
Points equal to five times your Cleric level. Choose
Bloodied creatures within 30 feet of yourself (which
can include you), and divide those Hit Points among
them. This feature can restore a creature to no
more than half its Hit Point maximum.
Level 6: Blessed Healer
The healing spells you cast on others heal you as
well. Immediately after you cast a spell with a spell
slot that restores Hit Points to one or more crea-
tures other than yourself, you regain Hit Points
equal to 2 plus the spell slot’s level.
Level 17: Supreme Healing
When you would normally roll one or more dice to
restore Hit Points to a creature with a spell or Chan-
nel Divinity, don’t roll those dice for the healing; in-
stead use the highest number possible for each die.
For example, instead of restoring 2d6 Hit Points to a
creature with a spell, you restore 12.

how you use those rules with Druid spells, which
appear on the Druid spell list later in the class’s
description.
Cantrips. You know two cantrips of your choice
from the Druid spell list. Druidcraft and Produce
Flame are recommended.
Whenever you gain a Druid level, you can replace
one of your cantrips with another cantrip of your
choice from the Druid spell list.
When you reach Druid levels 4 and 10, you learn
another cantrip of your choice from the Druid spell
list, as shown in the Cantrips column of the Druid
Features table.
Spell Slots. The Druid Features table shows how
many spell slots you have to cast your level 1+
spells. You regain all expended slots when you fin-
ish a Long Rest.
Prepared Spells of Level 1+. You prepare the
list of level 1+ spells that are available for you to
cast with this feature. To start, choose four level 1
spells from the Druid spell list. Animal Friendship,
Cure Wounds, Faerie Fire, and Thunderwave are
recommended.
The number of spells on your list increases as you
gain Druid levels, as shown in the Prepared Spells
column of the Druid Features table. Whenever that
number increases, choose additional spells from the
Druid spell list until the number of spells on your
list matches the number on the table. The chosen
spells must be of a level for which you have spell
slots. For example, if you’re a level 3 Druid, your list
of prepared spells can include six spells of levels 1
and 2 in any combination.
If another Druid feature gives you spells that
you always have prepared, those spells don’t count
against the number of spells you can prepare with
this feature, but those spells otherwise count as
Druid spells for you.
Changing Your Prepared Spells. Whenever you
finish a Long Rest, you can change your list of pre-
pared spells, replacing any of the spells with other
Druid spells for which you have spell slots.
Spellcasting Ability. Wisdom is your spellcasting
ability for your Druid spells.
Spellcasting Focus. You can use a Druidic Focus
as a Spellcasting Focus for your Druid spells.
Level 1: Druidic
You know Druidic, the secret language of Druids.
While learning this ancient tongue, you also un-
locked the magic of communicating with animals;
you always have the Speak with Animals spell
prepared.
You can use Druidic to leave hidden messages. You
and others who know Druidic automatically spot
such a message. Others spot the message’s presence
with a successful DC 15 Intelligence (Investigation)
check but can’t decipher it without magic.
Level 1: Primal Order
You have dedicated yourself to one of the following
sacred roles of your choice.
Magician. You know one extra cantrip from the
Druid spell list. In addition, your mystical connec-
tion to nature gives you a bonus to your Intelligence
(Arcana or Nature) checks. The bonus equals your
Wisdom modifier (minimum bonus of +1).
Warden. Trained for battle, you gain proficiency
with Martial weapons and training with Medium
armor.
Level 2: Wild Shape
The power of nature allows you to assume the form
of an animal. As a Bonus Action, you shape-shift into
a Beast form that you have learned for this feature
(see “Known Forms” below). You stay in that form
for a number of hours equal to half your Druid level
or until you use Wild Shape again, have the Incapac-
itated condition, or die. You can also leave the form
early as a Bonus Action.
Number of Uses. You can use Wild Shape twice.
You regain one expended use when you finish a
Short Rest, and you regain all expended uses when
you finish a Long Rest.
You gain additional uses when you reach certain
Druid levels, as shown in the Wild Shape column of
the Druid Features table.
Known Forms. You know four Beast forms for this
feature, chosen from among Beast stat blocks that
have a maximum Challenge Rating of 1/4 and that
lack a Fly Speed (see “Animals” in “Monsters” for
stat block options). The Rat, Riding Horse, Spider,
and Wolf are recommended. Whenever you finish a
Long Rest, you can replace one of your known forms
with another eligible form.
When you reach certain Druid levels, your number
of known forms and the maximum Challenge Rating
for those forms increases, as shown in the Beast
Shapes table. In addition, starting at level 8, you can
adopt a form that has a Fly Speed.
When choosing known forms, you may look in
other sources for eligible Beasts if the Game Master
permits you to do so.
Beast Shapes
Druid
Level

Forms

CR

2 4 1/4 No
4 6 1/2 No
8 8 1 Yes

Rules While Shape-Shifted. While in a form, you
retain your personality, memories, and ability to
speak, and the following rules apply:
Temporary Hit Points. When you assume a Wild
Shape form, you gain a number of Temporary Hit
Points equal to your Druid level.
Game Statistics. Your game statistics are replaced
by the Beast’s stat block, but you retain your crea-
ture type; Hit Points; Hit Point Dice; Intelligence,
Wisdom, and Charisma scores; class features;
languages; and feats. You also retain your skill
and saving throw proficiencies and use your Pro-
ficiency Bonus for them, in addition to gaining the
proficiencies of the creature. If a skill or saving
throw modifier in the Beast’s stat block is higher
than yours, use the one in the stat block.
No Spellcasting. You can’t cast spells, but shape-
shifting doesn’t break your Concentration or oth-
erwise interfere with a spell you’ve already cast.
Objects. Your ability to handle objects is deter-
mined by the form’s limbs rather than your own.
In addition, you choose whether your equipment
falls in your space, merges into your new form, or
is worn by it. Worn equipment functions as nor-
mal, but the GM decides whether it’s practical for
the new form to wear a piece of equipment based
on the creature’s size and shape. Your equipment
doesn’t change size or shape to match the new
form, and any equipment that the new form can’t
wear must either fall to the ground or merge with
the form. Equipment that merges with the form
has no effect while you’re in that form.
Level 2: Wild Companion
You can summon a nature spirit that assumes an
animal form to aid you. As a Magic action, you can
expend a spell slot or a use of Wild Shape to cast the
Find Familiar spell without Material components.
When you cast the spell in this way, the familiar is
Fey and disappears when you finish a Long Rest.
Level 3: Druid Subclass
You gain a Druid subclass of your choice. The Circle
of the Land subclass is detailed after this class’s de-
scription. A subclass is a specialization that grants
you features at certain Druid levels. For the rest of
your career, you gain each of your subclass’s fea-
tures that are of your Druid level or lower.
Level 4: Ability Score Improvement
You gain the Ability Score Improvement feat (see
“Feats”) or another feat of your choice for which you
qualify. You gain this feature again at Druid levels 8,
12, and 16.
Level 5: Wild Resurgence
Once on each of your turns, if you have no uses of
Wild Shape left, you can give yourself one use by ex-
pending a spell slot (no action required).
In addition, you can expend one use of Wild Shape
(no action required) to give yourself a level 1 spell
slot, but you can’t do so again until you finish a Long
Rest.
Level 7: Elemental Fury
The might of the elements flows through you. You
gain one of the following options of your choice.
Potent Spellcasting. Add your Wisdom modifier
to the damage you deal with any Druid cantrip.
Primal Strike. Once on each of your turns when
you hit a creature with an attack roll using a
weapon or a Beast form’s attack in Wild Shape, you

Lightning, or Thunder damage (choose when you
hit).

You gain an Epic Boon feat (see “Feats”) or another
feat of your choice for which you qualify. Boon of Di-
mensional Travel is recommended.
Level 20: Archdruid
The vitality of nature constantly blooms within you,
granting you the following benefits.
Evergreen Wild Shape. Whenever you roll Initia-
tive and have no uses of Wild Shape left, you regain
one expended use of it.
Nature Magician. You can convert uses of Wild
Shape into a spell slot (no action required). Choose
a number of your unexpended uses of Wild Shape
and convert them into a single spell slot, with each
use contributing 2 spell levels. For example, if you
convert two uses of Wild Shape, you produce a level
4 spell slot. Once you use this benefit, you can’t do
so again until you finish a Long Rest.
Longevity. The primal magic that you wield
causes you to age more slowly. For every ten years
that pass, your body ages only one year.

Druid Subclass:
Circle of the Land
Celebrate Connection to the Natural World
The Circle of the Land comprises mystics and sages
who safeguard ancient knowledge and rites. These
Druids meet within sacred circles of trees or stand-
ing stones to whisper primal secrets in Druidic. The
circle’s wisest members preside as the chief priests
of their communities.
Level 3: Circle of the Land Spells
Whenever you finish a Long Rest, choose one type
of land: arid, polar, temperate, or tropical. Consult
the table below that corresponds to the chosen
type; you have the spells listed for your Druid level
and lower prepared.

Level 3: Land’s Aid
As a Magic action, you can expend a use of your Wild
Shape and choose a point within 60 feet of yourself.
Vitality-giving flowers and life-draining thorns
appear for a moment in a 10-foot-radius Sphere cen-
tered on that point. Each creature of your choice in
the Sphere must make a Constitution saving throw
against your spell save DC, taking 2d6 Necrotic
damage on a failed save or half as much damage on
a successful one. One creature of your choice in that
area regains 2d6 Hit Points.
The damage and healing increase by 1d6 when
you reach Druid levels 10 (3d6) and 14 (4d6).
Level 6: Natural Recovery
You can cast one of the level 1+ spells that you have
prepared from your Circle Spells feature without
expending a spell slot, and you must finish a Long
Rest before you do so again.
In addition, when you finish a Short Rest, you can
choose expended spell slots to recover. The spell
slots can have a combined level that is equal to or
less than half your Druid level (round up), and none
of them can be level 6+. For example, if you’re a level
6 Druid, you can recover up to three levels’ worth of
spell slots. You can recover a level 3 spell slot, a level
2 and a level 1 spell slot, or three level 1 spell slots.
Once you recover spell slots with this feature, you
can’t do so again until you finish a Long Rest.
Level 10: Nature’s Ward
You are immune to the Poisoned condition, and you
have Resistance to a damage type associated with
your current land choice in the Circle Spells feature,
as shown in the Nature’s Ward table.

Shape and cause spectral trees and vines to appear
in a 15-foot Cube on the ground within 120 feet of
yourself. They last there for 1 minute or until you
have the Incapacitated condition or die. You and
your allies have Half Cover while in that area, and
your allies gain the current Resistance of your Na-
ture’s Ward while there.
As a Bonus Action, you can move the Cube up to
60 feet to ground within 120 feet of yourself.

You have a limited well of physical and mental
stamina that you can draw on. As a Bonus Action,
you can use it to regain Hit Points equal to 1d10
plus your Fighter level.
You can use this feature twice. You regain one
expended use when you finish a Short Rest, and you
regain all expended uses when you finish a Long
Rest.
When you reach certain Fighter levels, you gain
more uses of this feature, as shown in the Second
Wind column of the Fighter Features table.
Level 1: Weapon Mastery
Your training with weapons allows you to use the
mastery properties of three kinds of Simple or Mar-
tial weapons of your choice. Whenever you finish

once on a turn.
Level 2: Tactical Mind

field. When you fail an ability check, you can expend
a use of your Second Wind to push yourself toward

1d10 and add the number rolled to the ability check,
potentially turning it into a success. If the check still
fails, this use of Second Wind isn’t expended.

You gain a Fighter subclass of your choice. The
Champion subclass is detailed after this class’s de-

tures that are of your Fighter level or lower.

take the Attack action on your turn.
Level 5: Tactical Shift
Whenever you activate your Second Wind with a
Bonus Action, you can move up to half your Speed
without provoking Opportunity Attacks.

If you fail a saving throw, you can reroll it with a
bonus equal to your Fighter level. You must use the
new roll, and you can’t use this feature again until
you finish a Long Rest.
You can use this feature twice before a Long Rest
starting at level 13 and three times before a Long
Rest starting at level 17.
Level 9: Tactical Master
When you attack with a weapon whose mastery
property you can use, you can replace that property
with the Push, Sap, or Slow property for that attack.
Level 11: Two Extra Attacks
You can attack three times instead of once when-
ever you take the Attack action on your turn.

tack you make. If you make an attack roll against a
creature and miss, you have Advantage on your next
attack roll against that creature before the end of
your next turn.

feat of your choice for which you qualify. Boon of
Combat Prowess is recommended.

You can attack twice instead of once whenever you
take the Attack action on your turn.
Level 5: Stunning Strike
Once per turn when you hit a creature with a Monk
weapon or an Unarmed Strike, you can expend 1
Focus Point to attempt a stunning strike. The target
must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed
save, the target has the Stunned condition until the
start of your next turn. On a successful save, the
target’s Speed is halved until the start of your next
turn, and the next attack roll made against the tar-
get before then has Advantage.
Level 6: Empowered Strikes
Whenever you deal damage with your Unarmed
Strike, it can deal your choice of Force damage or its
normal damage type.
Level 7: Evasion
When you’re subjected to an effect that allows you
to make a Dexterity saving throw to take only half

creature within 5 feet of yourself that is Large or
smaller. You move the creature with you until the
end of your turn. The creature’s movement doesn’t
provoke Opportunity Attacks.
Level 10: Self-Restoration
Through sheer force of will, you can remove one
of the following conditions from yourself at the
end of each of your turns: Charmed, Frightened, or
Poisoned.
In addition, forgoing food and drink doesn’t give
you levels of Exhaustion.
Level 13: Deflect Energy
You can now use your Deflect Attacks feature
against attacks that deal any damage type, not just
Bludgeoning, Piercing, or Slashing.
Level 14: Disciplined Survivor
Your physical and mental discipline grant you profi-
ciency in all saving throws.
Additionally, whenever you make a saving throw
and fail, you can expend 1 Focus Point to reroll it,
and you must use the new roll.
Level 15: Perfect Focus

by your Flurry of Blows, you can impose one of the
following effects on that target.

ing throw or be pushed up to 15 feet away from you.

You can use this feature a number of times equal
to your Wisdom modifier (minimum of once), and
you regain all expended uses when you finish a

diately after that Bonus Action.
Level 17: Quivering Palm
You gain the ability to set up lethal vibrations in
someone’s body. When you hit a creature with an
Unarmed Strike, you can expend 4 Focus Points

tack action on your turn, you can forgo one of the
attacks to end the vibrations. To end them, you and
the target must be on the same plane of existence.
When you end them, the target must make a Consti-

B rEakinG your oatH
A Paladin tries to hold to the highest standards of
conduct, but even the most dedicated are fallible.
Sometimes a Paladin transgresses their oath.
A Paladin who has broken a vow typically seeks
absolution, spending an all-night vigil as a sign of pen-
itence or undertaking a fast. After a rite of forgive-
ness, the Paladin starts fresh.
If your Paladin unrepentantly violates their oath,
talk to your GM. Your Paladin should probably take a
more appropriate subclass or even abandon the class
and adopt another one.
As a Bonus Action, you can touch a creature
(which could be yourself) and draw power from the
pool of healing to restore a number of Hit Points to
that creature, up to the maximum amount remain-
ing in the pool.
You can also expend 5 Hit Points from the pool of
healing power to remove the Poisoned condition
from the creature; those points don’t also restore
Hit Points to the creature.
Level 1: Spellcasting
You have learned to cast spells through prayer and
meditation. See “Spells” for the rules on spellcast-
ing. The information below details how you use
those rules with Paladin spells, which appear in the
Paladin spell list later in the class’s description.
Spell Slots. The Paladin Features table shows
how many spell slots you have to cast your level 1+
spells. You regain all expended slots when you fin-
ish a Long Rest.
Prepared Spells of Level 1+. You prepare the
list of level 1+ spells that are available for you to
cast with this feature. To start, choose two level
1 Paladin spells. Heroism and Searing Smite are
recommended.
The number of spells on your list increases as
you gain Paladin levels, as shown in the Prepared
Spells column of the Paladin Features table. When-
ever that number increases, choose additional
Paladin spells until the number of spells on your
list matches the number in the Paladin Features
table. The chosen spells must be of a level for which
you have spell slots. For example, if you’re a level 5
Paladin, your list of prepared spells can include six
Paladin spells of level 1 or 2 in any combination.
If another Paladin feature gives you spells that
you always have prepared, those spells don’t count
against the number of spells you can prepare with
this feature, but those spells otherwise count as
Paladin spells for you.
Changing Your Prepared Spells. Whenever you
finish a Long Rest, you can replace one spell on your
list with another Paladin spell for which you have
spell slots.
Spellcasting Ability. Charisma is your spellcast-
ing ability for your Paladin spells.
Spellcasting Focus. You can use a Holy Symbol as
a Spellcasting Focus for your Paladin spells.
Level 1: Weapon Mastery
Your training with weapons allows you to use the
mastery properties of two kinds of weapons of your
choice with which you have proficiency, such as
Longswords and Javelins.
Whenever you finish a Long Rest, you can change
the kinds of weapons you chose. For example, you
could switch to using the mastery properties of Hal-
berds and Flails.
Level 2: Fighting Style
You gain a Fighting Style feat of your choice (see
“Feats” for feats). Instead of choosing one of those
feats, you can choose the option below.
Blessed Warrior. You learn two Cleric cantrips of
your choice (see the Cleric class’s section for a list
of Cleric spells). Guidance and Sacred Flame are rec-
ommended. The chosen cantrips count as Paladin
spells for you, and Charisma is your spellcasting
ability for them. Whenever you gain a Paladin level,
you can replace one of these cantrips with another
Cleric cantrip.
Level 2: Paladin’s Smite
You always have the Divine Smite spell prepared. In
addition, you can cast it without expending a spell
slot, but you must finish a Long Rest before you can
cast it in this way again.
Level 3: Channel Divinity
You can channel divine energy directly from the
Outer Planes, using it to fuel magical effects. You
start with one such effect: Divine Sense, which is
described below. Other Paladin features give addi-
tional Channel Divinity effect options. Each time
you use this class’s Channel Divinity, you choose
which effect from this class to create.
You can use this class’s Channel Divinity twice.
You regain one of its expended uses when you finish
a Short Rest, and you regain all expended uses when
you finish a Long Rest. You gain an additional use
when you reach Paladin level 11.

If a Channel Divinity effect requires a saving
throw, the DC equals the spell save DC from this
class’s Spellcasting feature.
Divine Sense. As a Bonus Action, you can open
your awareness to detect Celestials, Fiends, and
Undead. For the next 10 minutes or until you have
the Incapacitated condition, you know the location
of any creature of those types within 60 feet of
yourself, and you know its creature type. Within
the same radius, you also detect the presence of any
place or object that has been consecrated or dese-
crated, as with the Hallow spell.
Level 3: Paladin Subclass
You gain a Paladin subclass of your choice. The Oath
of Devotion subclass is detailed after this class’s de-
scription. A subclass is a specialization that grants
you features at certain Paladin levels. For the rest
of your career, you gain each of your subclass’s fea-
tures that are of your Paladin level or lower.
Level 4: Ability Score Improvement
You gain the Ability Score Improvement feat (see
“Feats”) or another feat of your choice for which you
qualify. You gain this feature again at Paladin levels
8, 12, and 16.
Level 5: Extra Attack
You can attack twice instead of once whenever you
take the Attack action on your turn.
Level 5: Faithful Steed
You can call on the aid of an otherworldly steed. You
always have the Find Steed spell prepared.
You can also cast the spell once without expend-
ing a spell slot, and you regain the ability to do so
when you finish a Long Rest.
Level 6: Aura of Protection
You radiate a protective, unseeable aura in a 10-foot
Emanation that originates from you. The aura is in-
active while you have the Incapacitated condition.
You and your allies in the aura gain a bonus to
saving throws equal to your Charisma modifier
(minimum bonus of +1).
If another Paladin is present, a creature can ben-
efit from only one Aura of Protection at a time; the
creature chooses which aura while in them.
Level 9: Abjure Foes
As a Magic action, you can expend one use of this
class’s Channel Divinity to overwhelm foes with
awe. As you present your Holy Symbol or weapon,
you can target a number of creatures equal to your
Charisma modifier (minimum of one creature) that
you can see within 60 feet of yourself. Each target
must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or have the
Frightened condition for 1 minute or until it takes
any damage. While Frightened in this way, a target
can do only one of the following on its turns: move,
take an action, or take a Bonus Action.
Level 10: Aura of Courage
You and your allies have Immunity to the Fright-
ened condition while in your Aura of Protection. If
a Frightened ally enters the aura, that condition has
no effect on that ally while there.
Level 11: Radiant Strikes
Your strikes now carry supernatural power. When
you hit a target with an attack roll using a Melee
weapon or an Unarmed Strike, the target takes an
extra 1d8 Radiant damage.
Level 14: Restoring Touch
When you use Lay On Hands on a creature, you can
also remove one or more of the following conditions
from the creature: Blinded, Charmed, Deafened,
Frightened, Paralyzed, or Stunned. You must ex-
pend 5 Hit Points from the healing pool of Lay On
Hands for each of these conditions you remove;
those points don’t also restore Hit Points to the
creature.
Level 18: Aura Expansion
Your Aura of Protection is now a 30-foot Emanation.
Level 19: Epic Boon
You gain an Epic Boon feat (see “Feats”) or another
feat of your choice for which you qualify. Boon of
Truesight is recommended.

Paladin Subclass: Oath of Devotion
Uphold the Ideals of Justice and Order
The Oath of Devotion binds Paladins to the ideals
of justice and order. These Paladins meet the ar-
chetype of the knight in shining armor. They hold
themselves to the highest standards of conduct, and
some—for better or worse—hold the rest of the
world to the same standards.
Many who swear this oath are devoted to gods
of law and good and use their gods’ tenets as the
measure of personal devotion. Others hold angels as
their ideals and incorporate images of angelic wings
into their helmets or coats of arms.
These paladins share the following tenets:
• Let your word be your promise.
• Protect the weak and never fear to act.
• Let your honorable deeds be an example.
Level 3: Oath of Devotion Spells
The magic of your oath ensures you always have
certain spells ready; when you reach a Paladin level
specified in the Oath of Devotion Spells table, you
thereafter always have the listed spells prepared.
Oath of Devotion Spells
Paladin Level Spells
3 Protection from Evil and Good,
Shield of Faith
5 Aid, Zone of Truth
9 Beacon of Hope, Dispel Magic
13 Freedom of Movement,
Guardian of Faith
17 Commune, Flame Strike
Level 3: Sacred Weapon
When you take the Attack action, you can expend
one use of your Channel Divinity to imbue one
Melee weapon that you are holding with positive
energy. For 10 minutes or until you use this feature
again, you add your Charisma modifier to attack
rolls you make with that weapon (minimum bonus
of +1), and each time you hit with it, you cause it to
deal its normal damage type or Radiant damage.
The weapon also emits Bright Light in a 20-foot
radius and Dim Light 20 feet beyond that.
You can end this effect early (no action required).
This effect also ends if you aren’t carrying the
weapon.
Level 7: Aura of Devotion
You and your allies have Immunity to the Charmed
condition while in your Aura of Protection. If a
Charmed ally enters the aura, that condition has no
effect on that ally while there.

Level 15: Smite of Protection
Your magical smite now radiates protective energy.
Whenever you cast Divine Smite, you and your allies
have Half Cover while in your Aura of Protection.
The aura has this benefit until the start of your next
turn.
Level 20: Holy Nimbus
As a Bonus Action, you can imbue your Aura of Pro-
tection with holy power, granting the benefits be-
low for 10 minutes or until you end them (no action
required). Once you use this feature, you can’t use it
again until you finish a Long Rest. You can also re-
store your use of it by expending a level 5 spell slot
(no action required).
Holy Ward. You have Advantage on any saving
throw you are forced to make by a Fiend or an
Undead.
Radiant Damage. Whenever an enemy starts its
turn in the aura, that creature takes Radiant dam-
age equal to your Charisma modifier plus your Pro-
ficiency Bonus.
Sunlight. The aura is filled with Bright Light that
is sunlight.

when you reach the specified Ranger levels. These
features are listed in the Ranger Features table.
Level 1: Spellcasting
You have learned to channel the magical essence of
nature to cast spells. See “Spells” for the rules on
spellcasting. The information below details how you
use those rules with Ranger spells, which appear in
the Ranger spell list later in the class’s description.
Spell Slots. The Ranger Features table shows
how many spell slots you have to cast your level 1+
spells. You regain all expended slots when you fin-
ish a Long Rest.

Prepared Spells of Level 1+. You prepare the
list of level 1+ spells that are available for you to
cast with this feature. To start, choose two level 1
Ranger spells. Cure Wounds and Ensnaring Strike are
recommended.
The number of spells on your list increases as you
gain Ranger levels, as shown in the Prepared Spells
column of the Ranger Features table. Whenever that
number increases, choose additional Ranger spells
until the number of spells on your list matches the
number in the Ranger Features table. The chosen
spells must be of a level for which you have spell
slots. For example, if you’re a level 5 Ranger, your
list of prepared spells can include six Ranger spells
of level 1 or 2 in any combination.
If another Ranger feature gives you spells that
you always have prepared, those spells don’t count
against the number of spells you can prepare with
this feature, but those spells otherwise count as
Ranger spells for you.
Changing Your Prepared Spells. Whenever you
finish a Long Rest, you can replace one spell on your
list with another Ranger spell for which you have
spell slots.

ability for your Ranger spells.

as a Spellcasting Focus for your Ranger spells.

umn of the Ranger Features table.

of your choice. Sleight of Hand and Stealth are rec-
ommended if you have proficiency in them.
At Rogue level 6, you gain Expertise in two more
of your skill proficiencies of your choice.
Level 1: Sneak Attack
You know how to strike subtly and exploit a foe’s
distraction. Once per turn, you can deal an extra
1d6 damage to one creature you hit with an attack

roll if you have Advantage on the roll and the attack
uses a Finesse or a Ranged weapon. The extra dam-
age’s type is the same as the weapon’s type.
You don’t need Advantage on the attack roll if at
least one of your allies is within 5 feet of the target,
the ally doesn’t have the Incapacitated condition,
and you don’t have Disadvantage on the attack roll.
The extra damage increases as you gain Rogue
levels, as shown in the Sneak Attack column of the
Rogue Features table.
Level 1: Thieves’ Cant
You picked up various languages in the commu-
nities where you plied your roguish talents. You
know Thieves’ Cant and one other language of your
choice, which you choose from the language tables
in “Character Creation.”
Level 1: Weapon Mastery
Your training with weapons allows you to use the
mastery properties of two kinds of weapons of your
choice with which you have proficiency, such as
Daggers and Shortbows.
Whenever you finish a Long Rest, you can change
the kinds of weapons you chose. For example, you
could switch to using the mastery properties of
Scimitars and Shortswords.
Level 2: Cunning Action
Your quick thinking and agility allow you to move
and act quickly. On your turn, you can take one of
the following actions as a Bonus Action: Dash, Dis-
engage, or Hide.
Level 3: Rogue Subclass
You gain a Rogue subclass of your choice. The Thief
subclass is detailed after this class’s description. A
subclass is a specialization that grants you features
at certain Rogue levels. For the rest of your career,
you gain each of your subclass’s features that are of
your Rogue level or lower.
Level 3: Steady Aim
As a Bonus Action, you give yourself Advantage on
your next attack roll on the current turn. You can
use this feature only if you haven’t moved during
this turn, and after you use it, your Speed is 0 until
the end of the current turn.

Level 4: Ability Score Improvement
You gain the Ability Score Improvement feat (see
“Feats”) or another feat of your choice for which you
qualify. You gain this feature again at Rogue levels
8, 10, 12, and 16.
Level 5: Cunning Strike
You’ve developed cunning ways to use your Sneak
Attack. When you deal Sneak Attack damage, you
can add one of the following Cunning Strike effects.
Each effect has a die cost, which is the number of
Sneak Attack damage dice you must forgo to add the
effect. You remove the die before rolling, and the
effect occurs immediately after the attack’s damage
is dealt. For example, if you add the Poison effect,
remove 1d6 from the Sneak Attack’s damage before
rolling.
If a Cunning Strike effect requires a saving throw,
the DC equals 8 plus your Dexterity modifier and
Proficiency Bonus.
Poison (Cost: 1d6). You add a toxin to your strike,
forcing the target to make a Constitution saving
throw. On a failed save, the target has the Poisoned
condition for 1 minute. At the end of each of its
turns, the Poisoned target repeats the save, ending
the effect on itself on a success.
To use this effect, you must have a Poisoner’s Kit
on your person.
Trip (Cost: 1d6). If the target is Large or smaller,
it must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or have
the Prone condition.
Withdraw (Cost: 1d6). Immediately after the
attack, you move up to half your Speed without pro-
voking Opportunity Attacks.
Level 5: Uncanny Dodge
When an attacker that you can see hits you with an
attack roll, you can take a Reaction to halve the at-
tack’s damage against you (round down).
Level 7: Evasion
You can nimbly dodge out of the way of certain dan-
gers. When you’re subjected to an effect that allows
you to make a Dexterity saving throw to take only
half damage, you instead take no damage if you
succeed on the saving throw and only half damage
if you fail. You can’t use this feature if you have the
Incapacitated condition.
Level 7: Reliable Talent
Whenever you make an ability check that uses one
of your skill or tool proficiencies, you can treat a
d20 roll of 9 or lower as a 10.
Level 11: Improved Cunning Strike
You can use up to two Cunning Strike effects when
you deal Sneak Attack damage, paying the die cost
for each effect.
Level 14: Devious Strikes
You’ve practiced new ways to use your Sneak Attack
deviously. The following effects are now among
your Cunning Strike options.
Daze (Cost: 2d6). The target must succeed on a
Constitution saving throw, or on its next turn, it can
do only one of the following: move or take an action
or a Bonus Action.
Knock Out (Cost: 6d6). The target must succeed
on a Constitution saving throw, or it has the Uncon-
scious condition for 1 minute or until it takes any
damage. The Unconscious target repeats the save
at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on
itself on a success.
Obscure (Cost: 3d6). The target must succeed on
a Dexterity saving throw, or it has the Blinded con-
dition until the end of its next turn.
Level 15: Slippery Mind
Your cunning mind is exceptionally difficult to con-
trol. You gain proficiency in Wisdom and Charisma
saving throws.
Level 18: Elusive
You’re so evasive that attackers rarely gain the
upper hand against you. No attack roll can have
Advantage against you unless you have the Incapac-
itated condition.
Level 19: Epic Boon
You gain an Epic Boon feat (see “Feats”) or another
feat of your choice for which you qualify. Boon of the
Night Spirit is recommended.
Level 20: Stroke of Luck
You have a marvelous knack for succeeding when
you need to. If you fail a D20 Test, you can turn the
roll into a 20.
Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again
until you finish a Short or Long Rest.

Rogue Subclass: Thief
Hunt for Treasure as a Classic Adventurer
A mix of burglar, treasure hunter, and explorer, you
are the epitome of an adventurer. In addition to im-
proving your agility and stealth, you gain abilities
useful for delving into ruins and getting maximum
benefit from the magic items you find there.
Level 3: Fast Hands
As a Bonus Action, you can do one of the following.
Sleight of Hand. Make a Dexterity (Sleight of
Hand) check to pick a lock or disarm a trap with
Thieves’ Tools or to pick a pocket.
Use an Object. Take the Utilize action, or take the
Magic action to use a magic item that requires that
action.
Level 3: Second-Story Work
You’ve trained to get into especially hard-to-reach
places, granting you these benefits.
Climber. You gain a Climb Speed equal to your
Speed.
Jumper. You can determine your jump distance
using your Dexterity rather than your Strength.
Level 9: Supreme Sneak
You gain the following Cunning Strike option.
Stealth Attack (Cost: 1d6). If you have the Hide
action’s Invisible condition, this attack doesn’t end
that condition on you if you end the turn behind
Three-Quarters Cover or Total Cover.
Level 13: Use Magic Device
You’ve learned how to maximize use of magic items,
granting you the following benefits.
Attunement. You can attune to up to four magic
items at once.
Charges. Whenever you use a magic item prop-
erty that expends charges, roll 1d6. On a roll of
6, you use the property without expending the
charges.
Scrolls. You can use any Spell Scroll, using Intelli-
gence as your spellcasting ability for the spell. If the
spell is a cantrip or a level 1 spell, you can cast it re-
liably. If the scroll contains a higher-level spell, you
must first succeed on an Intelligence (Arcana) check
(DC 10 plus the spell’s level). On a successful check,
you cast the spell from the scroll. On a failed check,
the scroll disintegrates.
Level 17: Thief’s Reflexes
You are adept at laying ambushes and quickly es-
caping danger. You can take two turns during the
first round of any combat. You take your first turn
at your normal Initiative and your second turn at
your Initiative minus 10.

Becoming a Sorcerer …
As a Level 1 Character
• Gain all the traits in the Core Sorcerer Traits
table.
• Gain the Sorcerer’s level 1 features, which are
listed in the Sorcerer Features table.
As a Multiclass Character
• Gain the Hit Point Die from the Core Sorcerer
Traits table.
• Gain the Sorcerer’s level 1 features, which are
listed in the Sorcerer Features table. See the mul-
ticlassing rules in “Character Creation” to deter-
mine your available spell slots.
Sorcerer Class Features
As a Sorcerer, you gain the following class features
when you reach the specified Sorcerer levels. These
features are listed in the Sorcerer Features table.
Level 1: Spellcasting
Drawing from your innate magic, you can cast
spells. See “Spells” for the rules on spellcasting. The
information below details how you use those rules
with Sorcerer spells, which appear in the Sorcerer
spell list later in the class’s description.
Cantrips. You know four Sorcerer cantrips of your
choice. Light, Prestidigitation, Shocking Grasp, and
Sorcerous Burst are recommended. Whenever you
gain a Sorcerer level, you can replace one of your
cantrips from this feature with another Sorcerer
cantrip of your choice.
When you reach Sorcerer levels 4 and 10, you
learn another Sorcerer cantrip of your choice, as
shown in the Cantrips column of the Sorcerer Fea-
tures table.
Spell Slots. The Sorcerer Features table shows
how many spell slots you have to cast your level 1+

spells. You regain all expended slots when you fin-
ish a Long Rest.
Prepared Spells of Level 1+. You prepare the list
of level 1+ spells that are available for you to cast
with this feature. To start, choose two level 1 Sor-
cerer spells. Burning Hands and Detect Magic are
recommended.
The number of spells on your list increases as
you gain Sorcerer levels, as shown in the Prepared
Spells column of the Sorcerer Features table. When-
ever that number increases, choose additional
Sorcerer spells until the number of spells on your
list matches the number in the Sorcerer Features
table. The chosen spells must be of a level for which
you have spell slots. For example, if you’re a level 3
Sorcerer, your list of prepared spells can include six
Sorcerer spells of level 1 or 2 in any combination.
If another Sorcerer feature gives you spells that
you always have prepared, those spells don’t count
against the number of spells you can prepare with
this feature, but those spells otherwise count as
Sorcerer spells for you.
Changing Your Prepared Spells. Whenever you
gain a Sorcerer level, you can replace one spell on
your list with another Sorcerer spell for which you
have spell slots.
Spellcasting Ability. Charisma is your spellcast-
ing ability for your Sorcerer spells.
Spellcasting Focus. You can use an Arcane Focus
as a Spellcasting Focus for your Sorcerer spells.
Level 1: Innate Sorcery
An event in your past left an indelible mark on you,
infusing you with simmering magic. As a Bonus
Action, you can unleash that magic for 1 minute,
during which you gain the following benefits:

• The spell save DC of your Sorcerer spells
increases by 1.
• You have Advantage on the attack rolls of
Sorcerer spells you cast.
You can use this feature twice, and you regain all
expended uses of it when you finish a Long Rest.
Level 2: Font of Magic
You can tap into the wellspring of magic within
yourself. This wellspring is represented by Sorcery
Points, which allow you to create a variety of magi-
cal effects.
You have 2 Sorcery Points, and you gain more as
you reach higher levels, as shown in the Sorcery
Points column of the Sorcerer Features table. You
can’t have more Sorcery Points than the number
shown in the table for your level. You regain all ex-
pended Sorcery Points when you finish a Long Rest.
You can use your Sorcery Points to fuel the op-
tions below, along with other features, such as
Metamagic, that use those points.
Converting Spell Slots to Sorcery Points. You
can expend a spell slot to gain a number of Sorcery
Points equal to the slot’s level (no action required).
Creating Spell Slots. As a Bonus Action, you can
transform unexpended Sorcery Points into one spell
slot. The Creating Spell Slots table shows the cost
of creating a spell slot of a given level, and it lists
the minimum Sorcerer level you must be to create
a slot. You can create a spell slot no higher than
level 5.
Any spell slot you create with this feature van-
ishes when you finish a Long Rest.

Level 2: Metamagic
Because your magic flows from within, you can
alter your spells to suit your needs; you gain two
Metamagic options of your choice from “Metamagic
Options” later in this class’s description. You use
the chosen options to temporarily modify spells you
cast. To use an option, you must spend the number
of Sorcery Points that it costs.
You can use only one Metamagic option on a spell
when you cast it unless otherwise noted in one of
those options.
Whenever you gain a Sorcerer level, you can re-
place one of your Metamagic options with one you
don’t know. You gain two more options at Sorcerer
level 10 and two more at Sorcerer level 17.
Level 3: Sorcerer Subclass
You gain a Sorcerer subclass of your choice. The
Draconic Sorcery subclass is detailed after this
class’s description. A subclass is a specialization
that grants you features at certain Sorcerer levels.
For the rest of your career, you gain each of your
subclass’s features that are of your Sorcerer level or
lower.
Level 4: Ability Score Improvement
You gain the Ability Score Improvement feat (see
“Feats”) or another feat of your choice for which you
qualify. You gain this feature again at Sorcerer lev-
els 8, 12, and 16.
Level 5: Sorcerous Restoration
When you finish a Short Rest, you can regain ex-
pended Sorcery Points, but no more than a number
equal to half your Sorcerer level (round down). Once
you use this feature, you can’t do so again until you
finish a Long Rest.
Level 7: Sorcery Incarnate
If you have no uses of Innate Sorcery left, you can
use it if you spend 2 Sorcery Points when you take
the Bonus Action to activate it.
In addition, while your Innate Sorcery feature is
active, you can use up to two of your Metamagic op-
tions on each spell you cast.
Level 19: Epic Boon
You gain an Epic Boon feat (see “Feats”) or another
feat of your choice for which you qualify. Boon of Di-
mensional Travel is recommended.
Level 20: Arcane Apotheosis
While your Innate Sorcery feature is active, you can
use one Metamagic option on each of your turns
without spending Sorcery Points on it.
Metamagic Options
The following options are available to your Meta-
magic feature. The options are presented in alpha-
betical order.
Careful Spell
Cost: 1 Sorcery Point
When you cast a spell that forces other creatures
to make a saving throw, you can protect some of
those creatures from the spell’s full force. To do so,
spend 1 Sorcery Point and choose a number of those
creatures up to your Charisma modifier (minimum
of one creature). A chosen creature automatically
succeeds on its saving throw against the spell, and

it takes no damage if it would normally take half
damage on a successful save.
Distant Spell
Cost: 1 Sorcery Point
When you cast a spell that has a range of at least 5
feet, you can spend 1 Sorcery Point to double the
spell’s range. Or when you cast a spell that has a
range of Touch, you can spend 1 Sorcery Point to
make the spell’s range 30 feet.
Empowered Spell
Cost: 1 Sorcery Point
When you roll damage for a spell, you can spend 1
Sorcery Point to reroll a number of the damage dice
up to your Charisma modifier (minimum of one),
and you must use the new rolls.
You can use Empowered Spell even if you’ve al-
ready used a different Metamagic option during the
casting of the spell.
Extended Spell
Cost: 1 Sorcery Point
When you cast a spell that has a duration of 1 min-
ute or longer, you can spend 1 Sorcery Point to dou-
ble its duration to a maximum duration of 24 hours.
If the affected spell requires Concentration, you
have Advantage on any saving throw you make to
maintain that Concentration.
Heightened Spell
Cost: 2 Sorcery Points
When you cast a spell that forces a creature to make
a saving throw, you can spend 2 Sorcery Points to
give one target of the spell Disadvantage on saves
against the spell.
Quickened Spell
Cost: 2 Sorcery Points
When you cast a spell that has a casting time of an
action, you can spend 2 Sorcery Points to change
the casting time to a Bonus Action for this casting.
You can’t modify a spell in this way if you’ve already
cast a level 1+ spell on the current turn, nor can you
cast a level 1+ spell on this turn after modifying a
spell in this way.
Seeking Spell
Cost: 1 Sorcery Point
If you make an attack roll for a spell and miss, you
can spend 1 Sorcery Point to reroll the d20, and you
must use the new roll.
You can use Seeking Spell even if you’ve already
used a different Metamagic option during the cast-
ing of the spell.
Subtle Spell
Cost: 1 Sorcery Point
When you cast a spell, you can spend 1 Sorcery
Point to cast it without any Verbal, Somatic, or Ma-
terial components, except Material components that
are consumed by the spell or that have a cost speci-
fied in the spell.
Transmuted Spell
Cost: 1 Sorcery Point
When you cast a spell that deals a type of damage
from the following list, you can spend 1 Sorcery
Point to change that damage type to one of the
other listed types: Acid, Cold, Fire, Lightning, Poi-
son, Thunder.
Twinned Spell
Cost: 1 Sorcery Point
When you cast a spell, such as Charm Person, that
can be cast with a higher-level spell slot to target an
additional creature, you can spend 1 Sorcery Point
to increase the spell’s effective level by 1.

betized, and each spell’s school of magic is listed.

Sorcerer Subclass: Draconic
Sorcery
Breathe the Magic of Dragons
Your innate magic comes from the gift of a dragon.
Perhaps an ancient dragon facing death bequeathed
some of its magical power to you or your ancestor.
You might have absorbed magic from a site infused
with dragons’ power. Or perhaps you handled a
treasure taken from a dragon’s hoard that was
steeped in draconic power. Or you might have a
dragon for an ancestor.
Level 3: Draconic Resilience
The magic in your body manifests physical traits
of your draconic gift. Your Hit Point maximum in-
creases by 3, and it increases by 1 whenever you
gain another Sorcerer level.
Parts of you are also covered by dragon-like
scales. While you aren’t wearing armor, your base
Armor Class equals 10 plus your Dexterity and Cha-
risma modifiers.

Level 3: Draconic Spells
When you reach a Sorcerer level specified in the
Draconic Spells table, you thereafter always have
the listed spells prepared.
Draconic Spells
Sorcerer
Level Spells
3 Alter Self, Chromatic Orb, Command,
Dragon’s Breath
5 Fear, Fly
7 Arcane Eye, Charm Monster
9 Legend Lore, Summon Dragon
Level 6: Elemental Affinity
Your draconic magic has an affinity with a damage
type associated with dragons. Choose one of those
types: Acid, Cold, Fire, Lightning, or Poison.
You have Resistance to that damage type, and
when you cast a spell that deals damage of that
type, you can add your Charisma modifier to one
damage roll of that spell.
Level 14: Dragon Wings
As a Bonus Action, you can cause draconic wings to
appear on your back. The wings last for 1 hour or
until you dismiss them (no action required). For the
duration, you have a Fly Speed of 60 feet.
Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again
until you finish a Long Rest unless you spend 3 Sor-
cery Points (no action required) to restore your use
of it.
Level 18: Dragon Companion
You can cast Summon Dragon without a Material
component. You can also cast it once without a spell
slot, and you regain the ability to cast it in this way
when you finish a Long Rest.
Whenever you start casting the spell, you can
modify it so that it doesn’t require Concentration. If
you do so, the spell’s duration becomes 1 minute for
that casting.

listed in the Warlock Features table.
As a Multiclass Character
• Gain the following traits from the Core Warlock
Traits table: Hit Point Die and training with Light
armor.
• Gain the Warlock’s level 1 features, which are
listed in the Warlock Features table. See the mul-
ticlassing rules in “Character Creation” to deter-
mine your available spell slots.
Warlock Class Features
As a Warlock, you gain the following class features
when you reach the specified Warlock levels. These
features are listed in the Warlock Features table.
Level 1: Eldritch Invocations
You have unearthed Eldritch Invocations, pieces of
forbidden knowledge that imbue you with an abid-
ing magical ability or other lessons. You gain one in-
vocation of your choice, such as Pact of the Tome. In-
vocations are described in the “Eldritch Invocation
Options” section later in this class’s description.
Prerequisites. If an invocation has a prerequi-
site, you must meet it to learn that invocation. For
example, if an invocation requires you to be a level
5+ Warlock, you can select the invocation once you
reach Warlock level 5.
Replacing and Gaining Invocations. Whenever
you gain a Warlock level, you can replace one of
your invocations with another one for which you

qualify. You can’t replace an invocation if it’s a pre-
requisite for another invocation that you have.
When you gain certain Warlock levels, you gain
more invocations of your choice, as shown in the In-
vocations column of the Warlock Features table.
You can’t pick the same invocation more than once
unless its description says otherwise.
Level 1: Pact Magic
Through occult ceremony, you have formed a pact
with a mysterious entity to gain magical powers.
The entity is a voice in the shadows—its identity
unclear—but its boon to you is concrete: the ability
to cast spells. See “Spells” for the rules on spell-
casting. The information below details how you use
those rules with Warlock spells, which appear in the
Warlock spell list later in the class’s description.
Cantrips. You know two Warlock cantrips of your
choice. Eldritch Blast and Prestidigitation are rec-
ommended. Whenever you gain a Warlock level, you
can replace one of your cantrips from this feature
with another Warlock cantrip of your choice.
When you reach Warlock levels 4 and 10, you
learn another Warlock cantrip of your choice, as
shown in the Cantrips column of the Warlock Fea-
tures table.
Spell Slots. The Warlock Features table shows
how many spell slots you have to cast your Warlock
spells of levels 1–5. The table also shows the level
of those slots, all of which are the same level. You
regain all expended Pact Magic spell slots when you
finish a Short or Long Rest.
For example, when you’re a level 5 Warlock, you
have two level 3 spell slots. To cast the level 1 spell
Charm Person, you must spend one of those slots,
and you cast it as a level 3 spell.
Prepared Spells of Level 1+. You prepare the
list of level 1+ spells that are available for you
to cast with this feature. To start, choose two
level 1 Warlock spells. Charm Person and Hex are
recommended.
The number of spells on your list increases as you
gain Warlock levels, as shown in the Prepared Spells
column of the Warlock Features table. Whenever
that number increases, choose additional War-
lock spells until the number of spells on your list
matches the number in the table. The chosen spells
must be of a level no higher than what’s shown in
the table’s Slot Level column for your level. When
you reach level 6, for example, you learn a new War-
lock spell, which can be of levels 1–3.
If another Warlock feature gives you spells that
you always have prepared, those spells don’t count

against the number of spells you can prepare with
this feature, but those spells otherwise count as
Warlock spells for you.
Changing Your Prepared Spells. Whenever you
gain a Warlock level, you can replace one spell on
your list with another Warlock spell of an eligible
level.
Spellcasting Ability. Charisma is the spellcasting
ability for your Warlock spells.
Spellcasting Focus. You can use an Arcane Focus
as a Spellcasting Focus for your Warlock spells.
Level 2: Magical Cunning
You can perform an esoteric rite for 1 minute. At
the end of it, you regain expended Pact Magic spell
slots but no more than a number equal to half your
maximum (round up). Once you use this feature, you
can’t do so again until you finish a Long Rest.
Level 3: Warlock Subclass
You gain a Warlock subclass of your choice. The
Fiend Patron subclass is detailed after this class’s
description. A subclass is a specialization that
grants you features at certain Warlock levels. For
the rest of your career, you gain each of your sub-
class’s features that are of your Warlock level or
lower.
Level 4: Ability Score Improvement
You gain the Ability Score Improvement feat (see
“Feats”) or another feat of your choice for which you
qualify. You gain this feature again at Warlock levels
8, 12, and 16.
Level 9: Contact Patron
In the past, you usually contacted your patron
through intermediaries. Now you can communicate
directly; you always have the Contact Other Plane
spell prepared. With this feature, you can cast the
spell without expending a spell slot to contact your
patron, and you automatically succeed on the spell’s
saving throw.
Once you cast the spell with this feature, you can’t
do so in this way again until you finish a Long Rest.
Level 11: Mystic Arcanum
Your patron grants you a magical secret called an
arcanum. Choose one level 6 Warlock spell as this
arcanum.
You can cast your arcanum spell once without ex-
pending a spell slot, and you must finish a Long Rest
before you can cast it in this way again.
As shown in the Warlock Features table, you gain
another Warlock spell of your choice that can be
cast in this way when you reach Warlock levels
13 (level 7 spell), 15 (level 8 spell), and 17 (level 9
spell). You regain all uses of your Mystic Arcanum
when you finish a Long Rest.
Whenever you gain a Warlock level, you can re-
place one of your arcanum spells with another War-
lock spell of the same level.
Level 19: Epic Boon
You gain an Epic Boon feat (see “Feats”) or another
feat of your choice for which you qualify. Boon of
Fate is recommended.
Level 20: Eldritch Master
When you use your Magical Cunning feature, you
regain all your expended Pact Magic spell slots.
Eldritch Invocation Options
Eldritch Invocation options appear in alphabetical

That Deals Damage

The Extra Attack of your Thirsting Blade invocation
confers two extra attacks rather than one.
Eldritch Mind
You have Advantage on Constitution saving throws
that you make to maintain Concentration.
Eldritch Smite
Prerequisite: Level 5+ Warlock, Pact of the Blade
Invocation
Once per turn when you hit a creature with your

than once. Each time you do so, choose a different
eligible cantrip.
Fiendish Vigor
Prerequisite: Level 2+ Warlock
You can cast False Life on yourself without expend-
ing a spell slot. When you cast the spell with this

Gaze of Two Minds
Prerequisite: Level 5+ Warlock
You can use a Bonus Action to touch a willing crea-
ture and perceive through its senses until the end
of your next turn. As long as the creature is on the
same plane of existence as you, you can take a Bo-
nus Action on subsequent turns to maintain this
connection, extending the duration until the end
of your next turn. The connection ends if you don’t
maintain it in this way.
While perceiving through the other creature’s
senses, you benefit from any special senses pos-
sessed by that creature, and you can cast spells as if
you were in your space or the other creature’s space
if the two of you are within 60 feet of each other.
Gift of the Depths
Prerequisite: Level 5+ Warlock
You can breathe underwater, and you gain a Swim
Speed equal to your Speed.
You can also cast Water Breathing once without
expending a spell slot. You regain the ability to cast
it in this way again when you finish a Long Rest.
Gift of the Protectors
Prerequisite: Level 9+ Warlock, Pact of the Tome
Invocation
A new page appears in your Book of Shadows when
you conjure it. With your permission, a creature can
take an action to write its name on that page, which
can contain a number of names equal to your Cha-
risma modifier (minimum of one name).
When any creature whose name is on the page is
reduced to 0 Hit Points but not killed outright, the
creature magically drops to 1 Hit Point instead.
Once this magic is triggered, no creature can benefit
from it until you finish a Long Rest.
As a Magic action, you can erase a name on the
page by touching it.
Investment of the Chain Master
Prerequisite: Level 5+ Warlock, Pact of the Chain
Invocation

moned familiar with a measure of your eldritch

you can cast Invisibility on yourself without expend-
ing a spell slot.
Otherworldly Leap
Prerequisite: Level 2+ Warlock
You can cast Jump on yourself without expending a
spell slot.
Pact of the Blade
As a Bonus Action, you can conjure a pact weapon
in your hand—a Simple or Martial Melee weapon of
your choice with which you bond—or create a bond
with a magic weapon you touch; you can’t bond with
a magic weapon if someone else is attuned to it or
another Warlock is bonded with it. Until the bond
ends, you have proficiency with the weapon, and
you can use it as a Spellcasting Focus.
Whenever you attack with the bonded weapon,
you can use your Charisma modifier for the attack
and damage rolls instead of using Strength or
Dexterity; and you can cause the weapon to deal
Necrotic, Psychic, or Radiant damage or its normal
damage type.
Your bond with the weapon ends if you use this
feature’s Bonus Action again, if the weapon is more
than 5 feet away from you for 1 minute or more, or
if you die. A conjured weapon disappears when the
bond ends.
Pact of the Chain
You learn the Find Familiar spell and can cast it as a
Magic action without expending a spell slot.
When you cast the spell, you choose one of the
normal forms for your familiar or one of the follow-
ing special forms: Imp, Pseudodragon, Quasit,
Skeleton, Sphinx of Wonder, Sprite, or Venomous
Snake (see “Monsters” for the familiar’s stat block).
Additionally, when you take the Attack action,
you can forgo one of your own attacks to allow
your familiar to make one attack of its own with its
Reaction.
Pact of the Tome
Stitching together strands of shadow, you conjure
forth a book in your hand at the end of a Short or
Long Rest. This Book of Shadows (you determine its
appearance) contains eldritch magic that only you
can access, granting you the benefits below. The
book disappears if you conjure another book with
this feature or if you die.
Cantrips and Rituals. When the book appears,
choose three cantrips, and choose two level 1 spells
that have the Ritual tag. The spells can be from any
class’s spell list, and they must be spells you don’t
already have prepared. While the book is on your
person, you have the chosen spells prepared, and
they function as Warlock spells for you.
Spellcasting Focus. You can use the book as a
Spellcasting Focus.
Repelling Blast
Prerequisite: Level 2+ Warlock, a Warlock Cantrip
That Deals Damage via an Attack Roll
Choose one of your known Warlock cantrips that
requires an attack roll. When you hit a Large or
smaller creature with that cantrip, you can push the
creature up to 10 feet straight away from you.
Repeatable. You can gain this invocation more
than once. Each time you do so, choose a different
eligible cantrip.
Thirsting Blade
Prerequisite: Level 5+ Warlock, Pact of the Blade

You gain the Extra Attack feature for your pact
weapon only. With that feature, you can attack
twice with the weapon instead of once when you
take the Attack action on your turn.

Warlock Subclass: Fiend Patron
Make a Deal with the Lower Planes
Your pact draws on the Lower Planes, the realms of
perdition. You might forge a bargain with a demon
lord, an archdevil, or another fiend that is especially
mighty. That patron’s aims are evil—the corruption
or destruction of all things, ultimately including
you—and your path is defined by the extent to
which you strive against those aims.
Level 3: Dark One’s Blessing
When you reduce an enemy to 0 Hit Points, you gain
Temporary Hit Points equal to your Charisma mod-
ifier plus your Warlock level (minimum of 1 Tempo-
rary Hit Point). You also gain this benefit if someone
else reduces an enemy within 10 feet of you to 0 Hit
Points.
Level 3: Fiend Spells
The magic of your patron ensures you always have
certain spells ready; when you reach a Warlock
level specified in the Fiend Spells table, you thereaf-
ter always have the listed spells prepared.
Fiend Spells
Warlock Level Spells
3 Burning Hands, Command,
Scorching Ray, Suggestion
5 Fireball, Stinking Cloud
7 Fire Shield, Wall of Fire
9 Geas, Insect Plague
Level 6: Dark One’s Own Luck
You can call on your fiendish patron to alter fate
in your favor. When you make an ability check or a
saving throw, you can use this feature to add 1d10
to your roll. You can do so after seeing the roll but
before any of the roll’s effects occur.
You can use this feature a number of times equal
to your Charisma modifier (minimum of once), but
you can use it no more than once per roll. You regain
all expended uses when you finish a Long Rest.
Level 10: Fiendish Resilience
Choose one damage type, other than Force, when-
ever you finish a Short or Long Rest. You have Resis-
tance to that damage type until you choose a differ-
ent one with this feature.
Level 14: Hurl Through Hell
Once per turn when you hit a creature with an
attack roll, you can try to instantly transport the
target through the Lower Planes. The target must
succeed on a Charisma saving throw against your
spell save DC, or the target disappears and hurtles
through a nightmare landscape. The target takes
8d10 Psychic damage if it isn’t a Fiend, and it has the
Incapacitated condition until the end of your next
turn, when it returns to the space it previously oc-
cupied or the nearest unoccupied space.
Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again
until you finish a Long Rest unless you expend a
Pact Magic spell slot (no action required) to restore
your use of it.

E xpandinG and rEplacinG a spEllBook
The spells you add to your spellbook as you gain
levels reflect your ongoing magical research, but you
might find other spells during your adventures that
you can add to the book. You could discover a Wiz-
ard spell on a Spell Scroll, for example, and then copy
it into your spellbook.
Copying a Spell into the Book. When you find
a level 1+ Wizard spell, you can copy it into your
spellbook if it’s of a level you can prepare and if you
have time to copy it. For each level of the spell, the
transcription takes 2 hours and costs 50 GP. After -
ward you can prepare the spell like the other spells
in your spellbook.
Copying the Book. You can copy a spell from
your spellbook into another book. This is like copy-
ing a new spell into your spellbook but faster, since
you already know how to cast the spell. You need
spend only 1 hour and 10 GP for each level of the
copied spell.
If you lose your spellbook, you can use the same
procedure to transcribe the Wizard spells that you
have prepared into a new spellbook. Filling out the
remainder of the new book requires you to find new
spells to do so. For this reason, many wizards keep a
backup spellbook.
When you reach Wizard levels 4 and 10, you learn
another Wizard cantrip of your choice, as shown in
the Cantrips column of the Wizard Features table.
Spellbook. Your wizardly apprenticeship cul-
minated in the creation of a unique book: your
spellbook. It is a Tiny object that weighs 3 pounds,
contains 100 pages, and can be read only by you or
someone casting Identify. You determine the book’s
appearance and materials, such as a gilt-edged tome
or a collection of vellum bound with twine.
The book contains the level 1+ spells you know. It
starts with six level 1 Wizard spells of your choice.
Detect Magic, Feather Fall, Mage Armor, Magic Mis-
sile, Sleep, and Thunderwave are recommended.
Whenever you gain a Wizard level after 1, add two
Wizard spells of your choice to your spellbook. Each
of these spells must be of a level for which you have
spell slots, as shown in the Wizard Features table.
The spells are the culmination of arcane research
you do regularly.
Spell Slots. The Wizard Features table shows
how many spell slots you have to cast your level 1+
spells. You regain all expended slots when you fin-
ish a Long Rest.
Prepared Spells of Level 1+. You prepare the list
of level 1+ spells that are available for you to cast
with this feature. To do so, choose four spells from
your spellbook. The chosen spells must be of a level
for which you have spell slots.
The number of spells on your list increases as you
gain Wizard levels, as shown in the Prepared Spells
column of the Wizard Features table. Whenever that
number increases, choose additional Wizard spells
until the number of spells on your list matches the
number in the table. The chosen spells must be of a
level for which you have spell slots. For example, if
you’re a level 3 Wizard, your list of prepared spells
can include six spells of levels 1 and 2 in any combi-
nation, chosen from your spellbook.
If another Wizard feature gives you spells that
you always have prepared, those spells don’t count
against the number of spells you can prepare with
this feature, but those spells otherwise count as
Wizard spells for you.
Changing Your Prepared Spells. Whenever you
finish a Long Rest, you can change your list of pre-
pared spells, replacing any of the spells there with
spells from your spellbook.
Spellcasting Ability. Intelligence is your spellcast-
ing ability for your Wizard spells.
Spellcasting Focus. You can use an Arcane Focus
or your spellbook as a Spellcasting Focus for your
Wizard spells.
Level 1: Ritual Adept
You can cast any spell as a Ritual if that spell has
the Ritual tag and the spell is in your spellbook. You
needn’t have the spell prepared, but you must read
from the book to cast a spell in this way.
Level 1: Arcane Recovery
You can regain some of your magical energy by
studying your spellbook. When you finish a Short
Rest, you can choose expended spell slots to re-
cover. The spell slots can have a combined level
equal to no more than half your Wizard level (round
up), and none of the slots can be level 6 or higher.
For example, if you’re a level 4 Wizard, you can re-
cover up to two levels’ worth of spell slots, regain-
ing either one level 2 spell slot or two level 1 spell
slots.
Once you use this feature, you can’t do so again

tures that are of your Wizard level or lower.

Wizard Subclass: Evoker
Create Explosive Elemental Effects
Your studies focus on magic that creates powerful
elemental effects such as bitter cold, searing flame,
rolling thunder, crackling lightning, and burning
acid. Some Evokers find employment in military
forces, serving as artillery to blast armies from
afar. Others use their power to protect others, while
some seek their own gain.
Level 3: Evocation Savant
Choose two Wizard spells from the Evocation
school, each of which must be no higher than level 2,
and add them to your spellbook for free.
In addition, whenever you gain access to a new
level of spell slots in this class, you can add one Wiz-
ard spell from the Evocation school to your spell-
book for free. The chosen spell must be of a level for
which you have spell slots.
Level 3: Potent Cantrip
Your damaging cantrips affect even creatures that
avoid the brunt of the effect. When you cast a can-
trip at a creature and you miss with the attack roll
or the target succeeds on a saving throw against the
cantrip, the target takes half the cantrip’s damage
(if any) but suffers no additional effect from the
cantrip.
Level 6: Sculpt Spells
You can create pockets of relative safety within the
effects of your evocations. When you cast an Evoca-
tion spell that affects other creatures that you can
see, you can choose a number of them equal to 1
plus the spell’s level. The chosen creatures automat-
ically succeed on their saving throws against the
spell, and they take no damage if they would nor-
mally take half damage on a successful save.
Level 10: Empowered Evocation
Whenever you cast a Wizard spell from the Evoca-
tion school, you can add your Intelligence modifier
to one damage roll of that spell.
Level 14: Overchannel
You can increase the power of your spells. When
you cast a Wizard spell with a spell slot of levels 1–5
that deals damage, you can deal maximum damage
with that spell on the turn you cast it.
The first time you do so, you suffer no adverse ef-
fect. If you use this feature again before you finish a
Long Rest, you take 2d12 Necrotic damage for each
level of the spell slot immediately after you cast it.
This damage ignores Resistance and Immunity.
Each time you use this feature again before finish-
ing a Long Rest, the Necrotic damage per spell level
increases by 1d12.

Character Origins
Character Backgrounds
Your character’s background is a collection of char-
acteristics that represent the place and occupation
that were most formative before your character em-
barked on a life of adventure.
Parts of a Background
A background includes the following parts.
Ability Scores
A background lists three of your character’s ability
scores. Increase one by 2 and another one by 1, or
increase all three by 1. None of these increases can
raise a score above 20.
Feat
A background gives your character a specified Ori-
gin feat (described in “Feats”).
Skill Proficiencies
A background gives your character proficiency in
two specified skills.
Tool Proficiency
Each background gives a character proficiency with
one tool—either a specific tool or one chosen from
the Artisan’s Tools category. Tools are detailed in

Each background offers a choice between a package
of equipment and 50 GP.

Character Species
When you choose your character’s species, you
determine whether your character is a human or a
member of a fantastical species, such as dragonborn
or gnome.
The peoples of the multiverse hail from different
worlds and include many kinds of sapient life forms.
A player character’s species is the set of game traits
that an adventurer gains from being one of those
life forms.
Some species can trace their origin to a single
world, plane of existence, or god, while other spe-
cies first appeared in multiple realms at once.
Whatever a species’ genesis, its members have
spread across the multiverse and contribute to
many different cultures.
Members of most species live for about 80 years,
with exceptions noted in the text about the spe-
cies in “Character Origins.” Regardless of life span,
members of all species reach physical maturity at
about the same age. Your character can be any age
that isn’t beyond their species’ normal life span.
Parts of a Species
A species includes the following parts.
Creature Type
A character’s species determines the character’s
creature type, which is described in “Rules Glos-
sary.” Every species in “Character Origins” is Hu-
manoid; playable non-Humanoid species appear in
other books.
Size
Your character’s species determines the character’s
size. Individuals within a species cover a wide range
of heights, and some species include such diversity

of size that you can choose whether your character
is Small or Medium.
Speed
Your character’s species determines the character’s
Speed.
Special Traits
Each species gives a character special traits—
unique characteristics based on the species’ physi-
ology or magical nature. When you choose a species,
your character gets all the special traits listed for it.
Some traits involve making a choice from a handful
of options.
Species Descriptions

Breath Weapon. When you take the Attack action
on your turn, you can replace one of your attacks
with an exhalation of magical energy in either a
15-foot Cone or a 30-foot Line that is 5 feet wide
(choose the shape each time). Each creature in that
area must make a Dexterity saving throw (DC 8 plus
your Constitution modifier and Proficiency Bonus).
On a failed save, a creature takes 1d10 damage of
the type determined by your Draconic Ancestry
trait. On a successful save, a creature takes half as
much damage. This damage increases by 1d10 when
you reach character levels 5 (2d10), 11 (3d10), and

try trait.

or until you retract the wings (no action required)
or have the Incapacitated condition. During that
time, you have a Fly Speed equal to your Speed. Your

use it again until you finish a Long Rest.

learn a higher-level spell, as shown on the table.
You always have that spell prepared. You can cast it
once without a spell slot, and you regain the ability
to cast it in that way when you finish a Long Rest.

casting ability for the spells you cast with this trait
(choose the ability when you select the lineage).
Fey Ancestry. You have Advantage on saving
throws you make to avoid or end the Charmed

minutes casting Prestidigitation to create a Tiny
clockwork device (AC 5, 1 HP), such as a toy, fire
starter, or music box. When you create the device,
you determine its function by choosing one effect
from Prestidigitation; the device produces that
effect whenever you or another creature takes a
Bonus Action to activate it with a touch. If the cho-
sen effect has options within it, you choose one of
those options for the device when you create it.
For example, if you choose the spell’s ignite-extin-
guish effect, you determine whether the device
ignites or extinguishes fire; the device doesn’t do

Coins
Characters often find coins on their adventures
and can spend those coins in shops, inns, and other
businesses. Coins come in different denominations
based on the relative worth of their material. The
Coin Values table lists coins and how much they’re
worth relative to the Gold Piece, which is the game’s
main coin. For example, 100 Copper Pieces are
worth 1 Gold Piece.
A coin weighs about a third of an ounce, so fifty
coins weigh a pound.

Weapons
The Weapons table in this section shows the game’s
main weapons. The table lists the cost and weight of
each weapon, as well as the following details:
Category. Every weapon falls into a category: Sim-
ple or Martial. Weapon proficiencies are usually
tied to one of these categories. For example, you
might have proficiency with Simple weapons.
Melee or Ranged. A weapon is classified as either
Melee or Ranged. A Melee weapon is used to at-
tack a target within 5 feet, whereas a Ranged
weapon is used to attack at a greater distance.
Damage. The table lists the amount of damage a
weapon deals when an attacker hits with it as well
as the type of that damage.
Properties. Any properties a weapon has are listed
in the Properties column. Each property is de-
fined in the “Properties” section.
Mastery. Each weapon has a mastery property,
which is defined in the “Mastery Properties” sec-
tion. To use that property, you must have a feature
that lets you use it.
Weapon Proficiency
Anyone can wield a weapon, but you must have
proficiency with it to add your Proficiency Bonus to
an attack roll you make with it. A player character’s
features can provide weapon proficiencies. A mon-
ster is proficient with any weapon in its stat block.
Properties
Here are definitions of the properties in the Proper-
ties column of the Weapons table.
Ammunition
You can use a weapon that has the Ammunition
property to make a ranged attack only if you have
ammunition to fire from it. The type of ammunition
required is specified with the weapon’s range. Each
attack expends one piece of ammunition. Drawing
the ammunition is part of the attack (you need a
free hand to load a one-handed weapon). After a
fight, you can spend 1 minute to recover half the
ammunition (round down) you used in the fight; the
rest is lost.
Finesse
When making an attack with a Finesse weapon, use
your choice of your Strength or Dexterity modifier
for the attack and damage rolls. You must use the
same modifier for both rolls.
Heavy
You have Disadvantage on attack rolls with a Heavy
weapon if it’s a Melee weapon and your Strength
score isn’t at least 13 or if it’s a Ranged weapon and
your Dexterity score isn’t at least 13.
Light
When you take the Attack action on your turn and
attack with a Light weapon, you can make one extra
attack as a Bonus Action later on the same turn.
That extra attack must be made with a different
Light weapon, and you don’t add your ability modi-
fier to the extra attack’s damage unless that modi-
fier is negative. For example, you can attack with a
Shortsword in one hand and a Dagger in the other
using the Attack action and a Bonus Action, but you
don’t add your Strength or Dexterity modifier to the
damage roll of the Bonus Action unless that modi-
fier is negative.

iMprovisEd wEapons
If you use an object—such as a table leg, frying pan,
or bottle—as a makeshift weapon, see “Improvised
Weapons” in “Rules Glossary.” Also see those rules
if you wield a weapon in an unusual way, such as using
a Ranged weapon to make a melee attack.
Loading
You can fire only one piece of ammunition from a
Loading weapon when you use an action, a Bonus
Action, or a Reaction to fire it, regardless of the
number of attacks you can normally make.
Range
A Range weapon has a range in parentheses after
the Ammunition or Thrown property. The range
lists two numbers. The first is the weapon’s normal
range in feet, and the second is the weapon’s long
range. When attacking a target beyond normal
range, you have Disadvantage on the attack roll. You
can’t attack a target beyond the long range.
Reach
A Reach weapon adds 5 feet to your reach when you
attack with it, as well as when determining your
reach for Opportunity Attacks with it.
Thrown
If a weapon has the Thrown property, you can
throw the weapon to make a ranged attack, and
you can draw that weapon as part of the attack. If
the weapon is a Melee weapon, use the same ability
modifier for the attack and damage rolls that you
use for a melee attack with that weapon.
Two-Handed
A Two-Handed weapon requires two hands when
you attack with it.
Versatile
A Versatile weapon can be used with one or two
hands. A damage value in parentheses appears with
the property. The weapon deals that damage when
used with two hands to make a melee attack.
Mastery Properties
Each weapon has a mastery property, which is us-
able only by a character who has a feature, such as
Weapon Mastery, that unlocks the property for the
character. The properties are defined below.
Cleave
If you hit a creature with a melee attack roll using
this weapon, you can make a melee attack roll with
the weapon against a second creature within 5 feet
of the first that is also within your reach. On a hit,
the second creature takes the weapon’s damage,
but don’t add your ability modifier to that damage
unless that modifier is negative. You can make this
extra attack only once per turn.
Graze
If your attack roll with this weapon misses a crea-
ture, you can deal damage to that creature equal
to the ability modifier you used to make the attack
roll. This damage is the same type dealt by the
weapon, and the damage can be increased only by
increasing the ability modifier.
Nick
When you make the extra attack of the Light prop-
erty, you can make it as part of the Attack action in-
stead of as a Bonus Action. You can make this extra
attack only once per turn.
Push
If you hit a creature with this weapon, you can push
the creature up to 10 feet straight away from your-
self if it is Large or smaller.
Sap
If you hit a creature with this weapon, that creature
has Disadvantage on its next attack roll before the
start of your next turn.
Slow
If you hit a creature with this weapon and deal
damage to it, you can reduce its Speed by 10 feet un-
til the start of your next turn. If the creature is hit
more than once by weapons that have this property,
the Speed reduction doesn’t exceed 10 feet.
Topple
If you hit a creature with this weapon, you can force
the creature to make a Constitution saving throw
(DC 8 plus the ability modifier used to make the
attack roll and your Proficiency Bonus). On a failed
save, the creature has the Prone condition.
Vex
If you hit a creature with this weapon and deal dam-
age to the creature, you have Advantage on your
next attack roll against that creature before the end
of your next turn.

Armor
The Armor table lists the game’s main armor. The
table includes the cost and weight of armor, as well
as the following details:
Category. Every type of armor falls into a category:
Light, Medium, or Heavy. The category determines
how long it takes to don or doff the armor (as
shown in the table).
Armor Class (AC). The table’s Armor Class column
tells you what your base AC is when you wear a
type of armor. For example, if you wear Leather
Armor, your base AC is 11 plus your Dexterity
modifier, whereas your AC is 16 in Chain Mail.
Strength. If the table shows a Strength score in the
Strength column for an armor type, that armor
reduces the wearer’s speed by 10 feet unless the
wearer has a Strength score equal to or higher
than the listed score.
Stealth. If the table shows “Disadvantage” in the
Stealth column for an armor type, the wearer has
Disadvantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks.
Armor Training
Anyone can don armor or hold a Shield, but only
those with training can use them effectively, as
explained below. A character’s class and other fea-
tures determine the character’s armor training.
A monster has training with any armor in its stat
block.
Light, Medium, or Heavy Armor
If you wear Light, Medium, or Heavy armor and lack
training with it, you have Disadvantage on any D20
Test that involves Strength or Dexterity, and you
can’t cast spells.
Shield
You gain the Armor Class benefit of a Shield only if
you have training with it.

mals’ stat blocks.

Large Vehicles
The Airborne and Waterborne Vehicles table pro-
vides statistics for various types of large vehicles.
The following notes apply.
Speed
A ship sailing against a strong wind moves at half
speed. In a dead calm (no wind), waterborne ships
can’t move under sail and must be rowed. Keelboats
and Rowboats are used on lakes and rivers. If going
downstream, add the speed of the current (typically
3 miles per hour) to the speed of the vehicle. These
vehicles can’t be rowed against any significant cur-
rent, but they can be pulled upstream by draft an-
imals on the shores. A Rowboat can be carried and
weighs 100 pounds.

Crew
A ship larger than a Keelboat or Rowboat needs a
crew of skilled hirelings (see “Hirelings” later in
“Equipment”) to function. The minimum number of
skilled hirelings needed to crew a ship depends on
the type of ship, as shown in the table.
Passengers
The table lists the number of Small and Medium
passengers the ship can accommodate using ham-
mocks. A ship outfitted with private accommoda-
tions can carry one-fifth as many passengers. A pas-
senger usually pays 5 SP per day for a hammock, but
prices can vary from ship to ship. A small private
cabin usually costs 2 GP per day.
Damage Threshold
If a vehicle has a damage threshold (see “Rules Glos-
sary”), it’s noted in the table.
Ship Repair
Repairs to a damaged ship can be made while the
vessel is berthed. Repairing 1 Hit Point of damage
requires 1 day and costs 20 GP for materials and la-
bor. If the repairs are made in a location where sup-
plies and skilled labor are abundant, such as a city
shipyard, the repair time and cost are halved.
Lifestyle Expenses
Lifestyle expenses summarize the cost of living in a
fantasy world. They cover lodging, food, equipment
maintenance, and other necessities.
At the start of each week or month (GM’s choice),
choose a lifestyle below—Wretched, Squalid, Poor,
Modest, Comfortable, Wealthy, or Aristocratic—and
pay the price to sustain that lifestyle.
Lifestyles have no inherent consequences, but the
GM might take them into account when determining
risks or how others perceive your character.
Wretched (Free)
You survive via chance and charity. You’re often
exposed to natural dangers as a result of sleeping
outside.
Squalid (1 SP per Day)
You spend the bare minimum for your necessities.
You might be exposed to unhealthy conditions and
opportunistic criminals.
Poor (2 SP per Day)
You spend frugally for your necessities.
Modest (1 GP per Day)
You support yourself at an average level.
Comfortable (2 GP per Day)
You spend modestly for your necessities and enjoy a
few luxuries.
Wealthy (4 GP per Day)
You’re accustomed to the finer things in life and
might have servants.
Aristocratic (10 GP per Day)
You pay for the best and might have a staff that sup-
ports your lifestyle. Others notice your wealth and
might encourage you to share it, either legally or
otherwise.
Food, Drink, and Lodging
The Food, Drink, and Lodging table gives prices for
food and a single night’s lodging. Prices for daily
lodging and meals are included in your lifestyle’s
expenses.

table is a minimum; some expert hirelings require
more pay. Untrained hirelings are hired for work
that requires no particular proficiencies; they in-
clude laborers and porters.

Spellcasting
Most settlements contain individuals who are will-
ing to cast spells in exchange for payment. If a spell
has expensive components, add the cost of those
components to the cost listed in the Spellcasting
Services table. The higher the level of a desired
spell, the harder it is to find someone to cast it.

Magic Items
Adventures hold the promise—but not a guaran-
tee—of finding magic items. Hundreds of magic
items are detailed in “Magic Items” later in this doc-
ument. Here’s what you need to know about using
magic items.
Identifying a Magic Item
Some magic items are indistinguishable from their
nonmagical counterparts, while others are conspic-
uously magical. Handling a magic item is enough to
give you a sense that it is extraordinary, but learn-
ing a magic item’s properties isn’t automatic.
The Identify spell is the fastest way to reveal an
item’s properties. Alternatively, you can focus on
one magic item during a Short Rest while being in
physical contact with the item. At the end of the
rest, you learn its properties and how to use them
(but not any curse the item might bear).
Sometimes a magic item carries a clue to its prop-
erties. The command word to activate a ring might
be etched inside the band, or a feathered design
might hint that it’s a Ring of Feather Falling.
Wearing or experimenting with an item can also
offer hints about its properties. In the specific case
of Potions, a little taste is enough to tell the taster
what a potion does. Other items might require more
experimentation. For example, if your character
puts on a Ring of Swimming, the GM might say, “Your
movement feels strangely fluid.” Perhaps you then
dive into a river to see what happens. The GM would
then say you swim unexpectedly well.
Attunement
Some magic items require a creature to form a
bond—called Attunement—with them before the
creature can use an item’s magical properties. With-
out becoming attuned to an item that requires At-
tunement, you gain only its nonmagical benefits un-
less its description states otherwise. For example, a
magic Shield that requires Attunement provides the
benefits of a normal Shield if you aren’t attuned to
it, but none of its magical properties.
Attune during a Short Rest
Attuning to an item requires you to spend a Short
Rest focused on only that item while being in physi-
cal contact with it (this can’t be the same Short Rest
used to learn the item’s properties). This focus can
take the form of weapon practice (for a Weapon),
meditation (for a Wand), or some other appropriate
activity. If the Short Rest is interrupted, the At-
tunement attempt fails. Otherwise, at the end of the
Short Rest, you’re attuned to the magic item and can
access its full magical capabilities.
No More Than Three Items
You can be attuned to no more than three magic
items at a time. Any attempt to attune to a fourth
item fails; you must end your Attunement to an item
first. Additionally, you can’t attune to more than
one copy of an item. For example, you can’t attune to
more than one Ring of Protection at a time.
Ending Attunement
Your Attunement to an item ends if you no longer
satisfy the prerequisites for Attunement, if the item
has been more than 100 feet away for at least 24
hours, if you die, or if another creature attunes to

the item. You can also voluntarily end Attunement
by spending another Short Rest focused on the item
unless the item is cursed.
Wearing and Wielding Items
Using a magic item’s properties might mean wear-
ing or wielding it. A magic item meant to be worn
must be donned in the intended fashion: boots go on
feet, gloves on hands, hats and helmets on a head,
and rings on a finger. Magic armor must be donned,
a Shield strapped to the arm, a cloak fastened about
the shoulders. A weapon must be held.
In most cases, a magic item that’s meant to be
worn can fit a creature regardless of size or build.
Magic garments are made to be easily adjustable, or
they magically adjust themselves to the wearer.
Multiple Items of the Same Kind
You can’t wear more than one of certain magic
items. You can’t normally wear more than one pair
of footwear, one pair of gloves or gauntlets, one pair
of bracers, one suit of armor, one item of headwear,
or one cloak. The GM might make exceptions.
Paired Items
Items that come in pairs—such as boots, bracers,
gauntlets, and gloves—impart their benefits only
if both items of the pair are worn. For example, a
character wearing a Boot of Striding and Springing
on one foot and a Boot of Elvenkind on the other foot
gains no benefit from either.
Crafting Nonmagical Items
To craft a nonmagical item, you need tools, raw ma-
terials, and time, each of which is detailed below. If
you meet the requirements, you make the item, and
you can use it or sell it at its normal price.
Tools
The “Tools” section of “Equipment” lists which tools
are required to make certain items. The GM assigns
required tools for items not listed there.
You must use the required tool to make an item
and have proficiency with that tool. Anyone who
helps you must also have proficiency with it.
Raw Materials
To make an item, you need raw materials worth
half its purchase cost (round down). For example,
you need 750 GP of raw materials to make Plate
Armor, which sells for 1,500 GP. The GM determines
whether appropriate raw materials are available.
Time
To determine how many days (working 8 hours a
day) it takes to make an item, divide its purchase
cost in GP by 10 (round a fraction up to a day). For
example, you need 5 days to make a Heavy Cross-
bow, which sells for 50 GP.
If an item requires multiple days, the days needn’t
be consecutive.
Characters can combine their efforts to shorten
the crafting time. Divide the time needed to create
an item by the number of characters working on it.
Normally, only one other character can assist you,
but the GM might allow more assistants.
Brewing Potions of Healing
A character who has proficiency with the Herbalism
Kit can create a Potion of Healing. Doing so requires
using that kit and 25 GP of raw material over the
course of 1 day (8 hours of work).
Scribing Spell Scrolls
A spellcaster can transfer a spell to a scroll and cre-
ate a Spell Scroll, using the rules below.
Time and Cost
Scribing a scroll takes an amount of time and money
based on the level of the spell, as shown in the Spell
Scroll Costs table. For each day of inscription, you
must work for 8 hours. If a scroll requires multiple
days, those days needn’t be consecutive.
Prerequisites for the Scribe
To scribe a scroll, you must have proficiency in the
Arcana skill or with Calligrapher’s Supplies and
have the spell prepared on each day of the inscrip-
tion. You must also have at hand any Material com-
ponents required by the spell; if the spell consumes
its Material components, they are consumed only
when you complete the scroll. The scroll’s spell uses
your spell save DC and spell attack bonus.
Cantrips
If the scribed spell is a cantrip, the version on the
scroll works as if the caster were your level.
Spell Scroll Costs
Spell Level Time Cost
Cantrip 1 day 15 GP
1 1 day 25 GP
2 3 days 100 GP
3 5 days 150 GP
4 10 days 1,000 GP
5 25 days 1,500 GP
6 40 days 10,000 GP
7 50 days 12,500 GP
8 60 days 15,000 GP
9 120 days 50,000 GP

castinG in arMor
You must have training with any armor you are wear-
ing to cast spells while wearing it. You are otherwise
too hampered by the armor for spellcasting.
