A Celestial might require a sizable donation of gold or magic items to an allied temple, while a Fiend might demand a living sacrifice or a gift of treasure.

By simply speaking aloud, you can alter reality itself.\nThe basic use of this spell is to duplicate any other spell of level 8 or lower. If you use it this way, you don't need to meet any requirements to cast that spell, including costly components. The spell simply takes effect.\nAlternatively, you can create one of the following effects of your choice:\nObject Creation. You create one object of up to 25,000 GP in value that isn't a magic item. The object can be no more than 300 feet in any dimension, and it appears in an unoccupied space that you can see on the ground.\nInstant Health. You allow yourself and up to twenty creatures that you can see to regain all Hit Points, and you end all effects on them listed in the Greater Restoration spell.\nResistance. You grant up to ten creatures that you can see Resistance to one damage type that you choose. This Resistance is permanent.\nSpell Immunity. You grant up to ten creatures you can see immunity to a single spell or other magical effect for 8 hours.\nSudden Learning. You replace one of your feats with another feat for which you are eligible. You lose all the benefits of the old feat and gain the benefits of the new one. You can't replace a feat that is a prerequisite for any of your other feats or features.\nRoll Redo. You undo a single recent event by forcing a reroll of any die roll made within the last round (including your last turn). Reality reshapes itself to accommodate the new result.\nReshape Reality. You may wish for something not included in any of the other effects. The GM has great latitude in ruling what occurs in such an instance.\nThe stress of casting Wish to produce any effect other than duplicating another spell weakens you. After enduring that stress, each time you cast a spell until you finish a Long Rest, you take 1d10 Necrotic damage per level of that spell. This damage can't be reduced or prevented in any way. In addition, your Strength score becomes 3 for 2d4 days. Finally, there is a 33 percent chance that you are unable to cast Wish ever again if you suffer this stress.",
